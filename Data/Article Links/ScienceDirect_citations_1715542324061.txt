Abstract: Nanostructured TiO2@Ag2O p-n heterojunction arrays were fabricated by combining the hydrothermal method with the chemical-bath method, and they were used as a photoelectrode in photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell for high-performance solar water splitting. To investigate the morphology, microstructure and composition, the pristine TiO2 nanowire arrays (TiO2 NWAs) and the TiO2 nanowires decorated with Ag2O nanoparticles (TiO2@Ag2O NWAs) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). Nanostructured TiO2 nanowire arrays were assembled with Ag2O nanoparticles, producing a large number of nano p-n heterojunctions. The TiO2@Ag2O p-n heterojunction arrays showed a photocurrent density of 1.61mA/cm2 at 1.23V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 0.5M Na2SO4 electrolyte under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100mW/cm2), two times higher than that of the pristine TiO2 NWAs. The enhancement was attributed to the efficient electron-hole separation because of the p-n heterojunction interface between p-Ag2O and n-TiO2, which were revealed by the electrochemical impedance spectra including both Mott-Schottky and Nyquist plots with or without illumination. TiO2@Ag2O p-n heterojunction arrays were expected to have the considerably potential applications in solar water splitting.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most aggressive and devastating human malignancies. In about 70% of PDACs the tumor suppressor gene TP53 is mutated generally resulting in conformational changes of mutant p53 (mutp53) proteins, which acquire oncogenic functions triggering aggressiveness of cancers and alteration of energetic metabolism. Here, we demonstrate that mutant p53 prevents the nuclear translocation of the glycolytic enzyme glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) stabilizing its cytoplasmic localization, thus supporting glycolysis of cancer cells and inhibiting cell death mechanisms mediated by nuclear GAPDH. We further show that the prevention of nuclear localization of GAPDH is mediated by both stimulation of AKT and repression of AMPK signaling, and is associated with the formation of the SIRT1:GAPDH complex. By using siRNA-GAPDH or an inhibitor of the enzyme, we functionally demonstrate that the maintenance of GAPDH in the cytosol has a critical impact on the anti-apoptotic and anti-autophagic effects driven by mutp53. Furthermore, the blockage of its mutp53-dependent cytoplasmic stabilization is able to restore the sensitivity of PDAC cells to the treatment with gemcitabine. Finally, our data suggest that mutp53-dependent enhanced glycolysis permits cancer cells to acquire sensitivity to anti-glycolytic drugs, such as 2-deoxyglucose, suggesting a potential personalized therapeutic approach in human cancers carrying mutant TP53 gene.

Abstract: We have previously shown that the Ste20-like kinase SLK interacts directly with the LIM domain-binding protein 1, Ldb1. Ldb1 knock down in murine fibroblasts activates SLK and enhances cell migration. To investigate the effect of Ldb1 deletion in ErbB2/HER2-driven tumorigenesis, Ldb1 conditional mice were crossed into MMTV-NIC mice, expressing the Neu oncogene and Cre recombinase from a bi-cistronic transgene. Our results show that Ldb1 is expressed in the mammary epithelium and that deletion of Ldb1 does not impair mammary gland development. Although high levels of Ldb1 can be correlated with poor prognosis in HER2+ breast cancers, Ldb1 ablation does not affect Neu-induced tumor progression in transgenic mice. Surprisingly, Ldb1 deletion did not affect SLK kinase activity in primary tumors or established cell lines. Nevertheless, Ldb1-deficient tumor cells showed enhanced mesenchymal and migratory characteristics in vitro. However, Ldb1-null cells failed to colonize the lungs of wildtype female mice when injected into the tail vein. Together our results show that Ldb1 is dispensable for mammary gland development and Neu-induced tumor progression but required for dissemination at secondary sites. Furthermore, our data also highlight contrasting cell line behaviours observed from in vivo and in vitro assays.

Abstract: Cell morphology is altered in the migration process, and the underlying cytoskeleton remodeling is highly dependent of intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Many calcium channels are known to be involved in migration. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) was demonstrated to be implicated in breast cancer cells migration, but its involvement in morphological changes during the migration process remains unclear. In the present work, we showed that IP3R3 expression was correlated to cell morphology. IP3R3 silencing induced rounding shape and decreased adhesion in invasive breast cancer cell lines. Moreover, IP3R3 silencing decreased ARHGAP18 expression, RhoA activity, Cdc42 expression and Y861FAK phosphorylation. Interestingly, IP3R3 was able to regulate profilin remodeling, without inducing any myosin II reorganization. IP3R3 silencing revealed an oscillatory calcium signature, with a predominant oscillating profile occurring in early wound repair. To summarize, we demonstrated that IP3R3 is able to modulate intracellular Ca2+ availability and to coordinate the remodeling of profilin cytoskeleton organization through the ARHGAP18/RhoA/mDia1/FAK pathway.

Abstract: Thin film Cu(In,Ga)Se2 solar cells remain one of the most promising devices for commercial photovoltaic panels. Aimed at high quality absorber film, alkali elements such as sodium and potassium incorporation can improve the crystal structure and electrical properties of the Cu(In,Ga)Se2 film. However, the precise control on sodium content as well as the incorporation mechanisms is yet comprehensively understood. We propose a facile wet chemistry oxidation approach for large area homogeneous Mo oxidation and allow for uniform sodium incorporation in a controllable manner. Eventually the oxidized Mo substrate in an optimal condition leads to a relative increase of 8% of conversion efficiency in the final solar device compared with the non-oxidized sample. We thoroughly examine the surface chemistry of the Mo substrate with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy after a systematic H2O2 oxidation treatment. A qualitative analysis show that the predominant Mo trioxides as a reservoir can adjust alkali elements contents in Cu(in,Ga)Se2 films. Upon oxidation, the narrowing down of Mo grain boundaries has now suppressed the over sufficient sodium incorporation compared to uncontrolled diffusion from soda lime glass. Also, the emergence of potassium element in the thin film improves the electrical properties. Thermodynamic calculation indicate that the K2MoO4 as an intermediate from K2O and MoO3 reaction is a preferable reaction path compared the Na2O reaction and thus enhanced potassium ion diffusion. We have correlate the sodium contents by simply adjusting the H2O2 treatment time to improved Cu(InGa)Se2 film qualities, e.g., crystal structures, grain sizes, charge carrier concentrations and defect densities.

Abstract: Nuclear import involves the recognition by importin (IMP) superfamily members of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) within protein cargoes destined for the nucleus, the best understood being recognition of classical NLSs (cNLSs) by the IMPα/β1 heterodimer. Although the cNLS consensus [K-(K/R)-X-(K/R) for positions P2–P5] is generally accepted, recent studies indicated that the contribution made by different residues at the P4 position can vary. Here, we apply a combination of microscopy, molecular dynamics, crystallography, in vitro binding, and bioinformatics approaches to show that the nature of residues at P4 indeed modulates cNLS function in the context of a prototypical Simian Virus 40 large tumor antigen-derived cNLS (KKRK, P2–5). Indeed, all hydrophobic substitutions in place of R impaired binding to IMPα and nuclear targeting, with the largest effect exerted by a G residue at P4. Substitution of R with neutral hydrophobic residues caused the loss of electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the P4 residue side chains and IMPα. Detailed bioinformatics analysis confirmed the importance of the P4 residue for cNLS function across the human proteome, with specific residues such as G being associated with low activity. Furthermore, we validate our findings for two additional cNLSs from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA polymerase catalytic subunit UL54 and processivity factor UL44, where a G residue at P4 results in a 2–3-fold decrease in NLS activity. Our results thus showed that the P4 residue makes a hitherto poorly appreciated contribution to nuclear import efficiency, which is essential to determining the precise nuclear levels of cargoes.

Abstract: Steroid receptor co-activator3 (SRC3) has been known to severe as an androgen receptor (AR) coactivator and is involved in the prostate cancer progression. Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) plays an important role in the cancer progression. However, the mechanism underlying the relationship between ncRNA and AR coactivators is still unclear. Here, we found a ncRNA, Nuclear Enriched Abundant Transcript 1 (NEAT1), was able to interact with SRC3 in the prostate cancer cell lines. NEAT1 can upregulate the AKT phosphorylation via a SRC3/IGF1R pathway. In function, NEAT1 promoted the prostate cancer cell growth through IGF1R/AKT signaling pathway. The NEAT1, SRC3, and IGF1R were highly expressed in the patients’ samples of prostate cancer. Therefore, we found a novel SRC3 binding ncRNA that can promote the prostate cancer cell growth through SRC3/IGF1R/AKT pathway.

Abstract: Numerous proteins require iron‑sulfur (Fe-S) clusters as cofactors for their function. Their biogenesis is a multi-step process occurring in the cytosol and mitochondria of all eukaryotes and additionally in plastids of photosynthetic eukaryotes. A basic model of Fe-S protein maturation in mitochondria has been obtained based on studies achieved in mammals and yeast, yet some molecular details, especially of the late steps, still require investigation. In particular, the late-acting biogenesis factors in plant mitochondria are poorly understood. In this study, we expressed the factors belonging to NFU, BOLA, SUFA/ISCA and IBA57 families in the respective yeast mutant strains. Expression of the Arabidopsis mitochondrial orthologs was usually sufficient to rescue the growth defects observed on specific media and/or to restore the abundance or activity of the defective Fe-S or lipoic acid-dependent enzymes. These data demonstrate that the plant mitochondrial counterparts, including duplicated isoforms, likely retained their ancestral functions. In contrast, the SUFA1 and IBA57.2 plastidial isoforms cannot rescue the lysine and glutamate auxotrophies of the respective isa1-isa2Δ and iba57Δ strains or of the isa1-isa2-iba57Δ triple mutant when expressed in combination. This suggests a specialization of the yeast mitochondrial and plant plastidial factors in these late steps of Fe-S protein biogenesis, possibly reflecting substrate-specific interactions in these different compartments.

Abstract: In order to enhance the thermal stability and thermochromic properties, three kinds of VOx-based thin films with different structures (single-layer, triple-layer and multi-layer, respectively) were designed in this study. All of them were prepared by room-temperature reactive magnetron sputtering and subsequently rapid thermal annealing (RTA) in nitrogen atmosphere. The optical properties and microstructure of VOx-based thin films were investigated. The results reveal that all samples are ascribed to pure VO2 (M), and the VOx-based thin films exhibit superior thermochromic properties with the solar modulation (ΔTsol) up to 12.75%, 15.65% and 18.02%, respectively. The phase transition temperature (Tc) is as low as 54°C for multi-layer thin films without doping, which indicates that the film design could effectively enhance optical switching and depress the Tc. After thermal treatment in the air, the phase of V2O5 appeared at 325°C, 275°C and 375°C for single-layer, triple-layer and multi-layer thin films, respectively, which indicates the multi-layer thin films show the best thermal stability. According to the degradation mechanism in this paper, the unbalance of interfacial stress and oxygen vacancies in VOx thin film accelerated the oxidation process, which results in the disappearance of thermochromic properties. Furthermore, the multi-layer thin films still show superior ΔTsol of 16.56% and Tc of 56°C, when it was taken out at 400°C and cooled quickly in air. Meanwhile, the annealing period could be reduced by 75% in comparison to cooling in vacuum chamber. Our research set forth a new avenue in enhancing the thermal stability and production efficiency, which can promote the practical applications of VOx-based thin films.

Abstract: LNCaP cells are derived from a metastatic lesion of human prostate adenocarcinoma. They express the classical androgen receptor (AR) and ZIP9, a Zn2+ transporter that also binds testosterone and mediates signaling by interacting with G-proteins. Our results show that LNCaP cells respond to testosterone by mobilizing their migratory machinery. Their exposure to testosterone triggers the formation of lamellipodia, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) at Tyr925 and of paxillin at Tyr118, expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), and cell migration. Silencing ZIP9 expression by means of siRNA does not affect the responsiveness of the classical AR to testosterone; however, it prevents all of the testosterone effects described above: formation of lamellipodia cannot be induced, stimulation of FAK or paxillin phosphorylation or MMP-2 expression is prevented, and cell migration does not take place in the absence of ZIP9. The data presented show that testosterone/ZIP9 interactions might have not only physiological but also pathophysiological relevance. The fact that the migratory machinery of a metastatic prostate cancer cell line is activated exclusively through testosterone/ZIP9 and not through testosterone/AR interactions suggests that targeting specific inhibition of testosterone/ZIP9-mediated events might help in developing new therapeutic strategies against androgen-induced progression of prostate cancer.

Abstract: In this study, colorless to neutral-grayish color ECDs based on the consecutive anchoring of alkyl-substituted and aryl substituted symmetric viologens (blue and green switching vilogens respectively) are reported. The strong binding affinity towards nanostructured TiO2 layer of both viologens equally provided with phosphonate anchoring group, allows the employment of a single nanostructured layer wherein both viologens were adsorbed (glass/TCO/viologens-modified-TiO2/TCO/glass), while showing very rapid anchoring times (≤15min). The effect of the TiO2 layer thickness and grafting conditions on the ECD performance have also been investigated, reaching switching times ≤6s and good performance up to 2000 cycles for the optimized ECDs. Additionally, the influence of the electrolyte on the observed coloration has also been explored. The use of water-based gel polyelectrolyte has allowed significant enhancement of the neutral-grayish EC behavior (a* and b*≤ |10|). The beneficial impact of water-based gel polyelectrolyte and potential in color-tailored electrochromics is emphasized.

Abstract: L-type CaV1.2 channels are key regulators of gene expression, cell excitability and muscle contraction. CaV1.2 channels organize in clusters throughout the plasma membrane. This channel organization has been suggested to contribute to the concerted activation of adjacent CaV1.2 channels (e.g. cooperative gating). Here, we tested the hypothesis that dynamic intracellular and perimembrane trafficking of CaV1.2 channels is critical for formation and dissolution of functional channel clusters mediating cooperative gating. We found that CaV1.2 moves in vesicular structures of circular and tubular shape with diverse intracellular and submembrane trafficking patterns. Both microtubules and actin filaments are required for dynamic movement of CaV1.2 vesicles. These vesicles undergo constitutive homotypic fusion and fission events that sustain CaV1.2 clustering, channel activity and cooperative gating. Our study suggests that CaV1.2 clusters and activity can be modulated by diverse and unique intracellular and perimembrane vesicular dynamics to fine-tune Ca2+ signals.

Abstract: The proper design of the multi-junction solar cell (MJSC) requires the optimisation search through the vast parameter space, with parameters for the proper operation quite often being constrained, like the current matching throughout the cell. Due to high complexity number of MJSC device parameters might be huge, which makes it a demanding task for the most of the optimising strategies based on gradient algorithm. One way to overcome those difficulties is to employ the global optimisation algorithms based on the stochastic search. We present the procedure for the design of MJSC based on the heuristic method, the genetic algorithm, taking into account physical parameters of the solar cell as well as various relevant radiative and non-radiative losses. In the presented model, the number of optimising parameters is 5M+1 for a series constrained M-junctions solar cell. Diffusion dark current, radiative and Auger recombinations are taken into account with actual ASTM G173-03 Global tilted solar spectra, while the absorption properties of individual SCs were calculated using the multi band k·p Hamiltonian. We predicted the efficiencies in case of M=4 to be 50.8% and 55.2% when all losses are taken into account and with only radiative recombination, respectively.

Abstract: Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) hold great promise as attractive vehicles to deliver therapeutic agents against cancer, while the cross-talk between MSCs and cancer cells remains controversial. Here in an indirect co-culture system we observed that MSCs induced the malignancy transformation of low malignancy cancer cells HT29 and MCF7, whereas MSCs were reprogrammed by high malignancy cancer cells HCT116 and MDA-MB-231 without exerting an obvious influence on them. We further demonstrated that the RNA-binding protein polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) was suppressed in low malignancy cancer cells co-cultured with MSCs. Moreover, shRNA mediated silencing of PTBP1 could promote the invasiveness of HT29 cells while over-expression of PTBP1 attenuate the MSC-induced invasion of HT29 cells. Our results suggested that differential effects of MSCs on the invasion of cancer cells partially corresponded to PTBP1 expression in cancer cells and the maintenance of biological characteristics in MSCs, which insight could provide a theoretical basis for evaluating the safety of MSC application and PTBP1 targeting in cancer treatment.

Abstract: Differentiation of naïve CD4+ T cells into effector subtypes with distinct cytokine profiles and physiological roles is a tightly regulated process, the imbalance of which can lead to an inadequate immune response or autoimmune disease. The crucial role of Ca2+ signals, mainly mediated by the store operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) in shaping the immune response is well described. However, it is unclear if human effector CD4+ T cell subsets show differential Ca2+ signatures in response to different stimulation methods. Herein, we provide optimized in vitro culture conditions for polarization of human CD4+ effector T cells and characterize their SOCE following both pharmacological store depletion and direct T-cell receptor (TCR) activation. Moreover, we measured whole cell Ca2+ release activated Ca2+ currents (ICRAC) and investigated whether the observed differences correlate to the expression of CRAC genes. Our results show that Ca2+ profiles of helper CD4+ Th1, Th2 and Th17 are distinct and in part shaped by the intensity of stimulation. Regulatory T cells (Treg) are unique being the subtype with the most prominent SOCE response. Analysis of in vivo differentiated Treg unraveled the role of differential expression of ORAI2 in fine-tuning signals in Treg vs. conventional CD4+ T cells.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of pancreatic islet-derived mesenchymal stem cell (PID-MSC) differentiation into beta-cells in the presence of insulin and leptin resistance stimulators. We determined that beta-cell differentiation was stimulated by glucose, insulin, and leptin. Co-administration of insulin and leptin resulted in greater, at a further stage of differentiation but non-functional beta-cell formation. The levels of p-AKT(Ser473) did not change; SOCS3, PTP1B, p-IRS1(Ser307), PTEN levels increased and p-IRS1(Try) levels decreased due to insulin and leptin co-administration. These findings suggest that co-administration of insulin and leptin to PID-MSCs results in the development of both insulin and leptin resistance together. We showed that this differentiation signaling is mainly mediated by AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin and Tub. Moreover, β-catenin and Tub were linked to each other in the nucleus under this condition. Furthermore, we found that Tub and β-catenin contributes to insulin production by increasing the expression of transcription factors by binding to the promoter regions of ins1, ins2, and pdx1 genes. In addition, Tub is also bound to the promoter region of the MafA gene. These findings demonstrate that when insulin and leptin resistance develop together in rat PID-MSCs beta-cell differentiation increases markedly via β-catenin and Tub. New therapeutic agents that inhibit AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin and in particular Tub may help prevent the development or retard the progression of type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: Transport properties of photo-induced charge carriers through different grains in the polycrystalline photovoltaic devices strongly depend on the microstructural pattern of the active layers. Therefore, photocurrent mapping with nanoscale resolution is important to know about the electrical responses of the different grains in the polycrystalline photovoltaic devices. Here, we have used photoconductive atomic force microscopy for mapping the photocurrent with nanoscale resolution of two types of ZnO nanorods/Cu2O based solar cells. The morphology and current have been measured simultaneously with nanoscale resolution from the top surfaces of the devices at different applied voltages. It is demonstrated that the nanostructure of the active layers is one of the most important variables determining device performances. Different local photovoltaic performances have been observed from these two devices due to various microstructural and electrical phenomena of their seed layers. On the other hand, significant variations in short-circuit current have been observed from different grains of the devices which appeared more alike in the micrograph owing to various transport properties of photocarriers. It is observed that the grain boundaries are more preferable for charge collection over the grain interiors. It shows a higher short circuit current close to the boundary than the grain inside. This study illustrates an important area for future fundamental research to enhance the performances of the polycrystalline photovoltaic devices through better control of morphology and improving the inherent properties of the active layers.

Abstract: A tandem layer structured ZrC-ZrOx/Al2O3 coatings are deposited onto stainless steel (SS) substrates by the sputtering method for solar selective absorbing. The ZrC-ZrOx and Al2O3 layers work as an absorptance layer and an antireflectance layer, respectively. The substrate temperature has an important effect on the optical properties of the coating. With a high substrate temperature (300°C), the SS/ZrC-ZrOx/Al2O3 coatings exhibit a relatively high absorptance of 0.92 and a relatively low emittance of 0.12. The composition, structure, optical properties and surface morphology of the coatings are characterized using SEM, EDS, XPS, Raman, UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometry and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Detailed failure analysis of the SS/ZrC-ZrOx/Al2O3 coatings in vacuum and air is conducted.

Abstract: Acquiring good adhesion of ITO thin films on polymer substrate is a major concern, especially for space related applications. Delamination of ITO coating on these polymers can seriously damage the spacecraft. This paper presents the development of highly transparent and conducting ITO thin films on as-received and surface treated fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) and Kapton® substrates by reactive direct current magnetron sputtering. Stability of the ITO coating on FEP and Kapton® substrates was studied in simulated space environments. Environmental tests such as: relative humidity, thermal cycling and thermo vacuum were performed. Thermo-optical properties and sheet resistance of ITO coated FEP and Kapton® substrates were studied before and after environmental tests. Optimized ITO coating with thickness of ~ 15nm on FEP and Kapton® substrates showed sheet resistance in the range of 2–4kΩ/sq. with high average transmittance and high IR emittance. Adhesion of ITO coating on FEP substrate was improved by Ar plasma etching. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and field emission scanning electron microscopic studies of etched FEP substrate showed defluorination and high roughness of the etched surface which helped for better adhesion of ITO coating. We demonstrated that ITO coated plasma etched FEP substrate showed no change in the sheet resistance and thermo-optical properties. Moreover, ITO coated etched FEP substrate showed good environmental stability than ITO coated untreated FEP substrates.

Abstract: Transparent conducting electrodes based on silver nanowires (AgNWs) have arisen great interest due to their excellent photoelectric properties compared with the conventional sputtered indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes. However, the practical applications of these electrodes are limited due to their coarse surface morphology, weak mechanical adhesion and high junction resistivity as well as poor thermal and chemical stability. In this work, we develop a new processing technique to resolve all above limitations by embedding random AgNWs networks in solution-processed conductive aluminum-doped zinc oxide nanoparticles (AZO-NPs) matrices via a spin-coating process at low temperature (150°C). Our results show that coating the AZO-NPs on the surface of AgNWs networks effectively fill the holes between AgNWs and tightened the AgNWs junctions, resulting in ultralow surface roughness and excellent wire-substrate mechanical adhesion. Surrounding the AgNWs by conductive AZO-NPs could provide more electron transport channels between AgNWs so as to improve the wire-wire electrical conductivity. The resulting composite electrodes demonstrated an excellent performance with low sheet resistivity < 28Ω/sq, high optical transmittance > 91% at 550nm, excellent thermal stability at temperature as high as 270°C, good chemical corrosion resistance, and retained high electrical conductivity showing less 1% deviation in sheet resistivity after 300 continuous convex and concave bending cycle. Kesterite pure sulfide Cu2ZnSnS4 thin film solar cells using such composite electrodes as top contact show a best conversion efficiency of 7.45%, achieving a 11.5% increase compared with conventionally sputtered ITO-based CZTS thin film solar cells due to higher short circuit current density and fill factor.

Abstract: Light-adaptable (LA) displays combining the advantages of reflective and emissive displays, are considered as the future of display technology. Electrochromic devices are potentially strong candidates for reflective-mode LA displays because of their high transmittance in the transparent state and low power consumption. However, the narrow viewing angle of these displays in relation to a hybrid structure of the LA display, is a technical barrier that must be overcome for the successful application of electrochromic devices to light-adaptable displays. In the present study, an electrochromic device with a self-diffusing function was developed for application to light-adaptable displays. Si3N4 scattering particles were incorporated in the TiO2 nanostructure-based electrochromic device. Efficient forward diffuse scatterings were obtained without deteriorating the total transmittance of the device. The contrast ratio and color gamut of the electrochromic device were dramatically improved because of the addition of the scattering particles.

Abstract: ADAM17, a prominent member of the “Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase” (ADAM) family, controls vital cellular functions through cleavage of transmembrane substrates including TGF-alpha, Amphiregulin (AREG) and TNF-Receptor 1 (TNFR1). We recently presented evidence that surface exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) is pivotal for ADAM17 to exert sheddase activity. Anoctamin-6 (ANO6) has Ca2+-dependent phospholipid scramblase activity and it followed that the functions of ANO6 and ADAM17 might be linked. We report that overexpression of ANO6 in HEK293T cells led to increased Ca2+-mediated PS-exposure that was indeed accompanied by enhanced release of AREG and TGF-alpha. The effect was not observed when cells were treated with the PKC-dependent ADAM17 activator PMA. Transformation of cells with a constitutively active ANO6 mutant led to spontaneous PS-exposure and to the release of ADAM17-substrates in the absence of any stimuli. Inhibitor experiments indicated that ANO6-mediated enhancement of substrate cleavage simultaneously broadened the spectrum of participating metalloproteinases. In complementary experiments, siRNA-mediated downregulation of ANO6 was shown to decrease ionophore-mediated release of TNFR1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We conclude that ANO6, by virtue of its scramblase activity, may play a role as an important regulator of the ADAM-network in the plasma membrane.

Abstract: Despite the development of novel targeted therapies, de novo or acquired chemoresistance remains a significant factor for treatment failure in breast cancer therapeutics. Neratinib and dacomitinib are irreversible panHER inhibitors, which block their autophosphorylation and downstream signaling. Moreover, neratinib and dacomitinib have been shown to activate cell death in HER2-overexpressing cell lines. Here we showed that increased MCL1 and decreased BIM and PUMA mediated resistance to neratinib in ZR-75-30 and SKBR3 cells while increased BCL-XL and BCL-2 and decreased BIM and PUMA promoted neratinib resistance in BT474 cells. Cells were also cross-resistant to dacomitinib. BH3 profiles of HER2+ breast cancer cells efficiently predicted antiapoptotic protein dependence and development of resistance to panHER inhibitors. Reactivation of ERK1/2 was primarily responsible for acquired resistance in SKBR3 and ZR-75-30 cells. Adding specific ERK1/2 inhibitor SCH772984 to neratinib or dacomitinib led to increased apoptotic response in neratinib-resistant SKBR3 and ZR-75-30 cells, but we did not detect a similar response in neratinib-resistant BT474 cells. Accordingly, suppression of BCL-2/BCL-XL by ABT-737 was required in addition to ERK1/2 inhibition for neratinib- or dacomitinib-induced apoptosis in neratinib-resistant BT474 cells. Our results showed that different mitochondrial apoptotic blocks mediated acquired panHER inhibitor resistance in HER2+ breast cancer cell lines as well as highlighted the potential of BH3 profiling assay in prediction of panHER inhibitor resistance in breast cancer cells.

Abstract: In a previous paper [1], we reported on Cu(In,Ga)Se2-based (CIGS) solar cell samples collected from different research laboratories and industrial companies with the purpose of understanding the range of CIGS materials that can lead to high-quality and high-efficiency solar panels. Here, we report on electrical measurements of those same samples. Electron-beam induced current and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) gave insights about the collection probability and the lifetime of carriers generated in each absorber. Capacitance and drive-level capacitance profiling revealed nonuniformity in carrier-density profiles. Admittance spectroscopy revealed small activation energies (≤ 0.03eV) indicative of the inversion strength, larger activation energies (> 0.1eV) reflective of thermal activation of absorber conductivity and a deeper defect level. Deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) probed deep hole-trapping defects and showed that all samples in this study had a majority-carrier defect with activation energy between 0.3eV and 0.9eV. Optical-DLTS revealed deep electron-trapping defects in several of the CIGS samples. This work focused on revealing similarities and differences between high-quality CIGS solar cells made with various structures and fabrication techniques.

Abstract: Neutrophils can release their chromatin to form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), a process known as NETosis. Although NET formation can be induced by various stimuli, recent evidence suggests that these stimuli do so via different mechanisms. Here, we have analysed NET formation induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol 12‑myristate 13‑acetate (PMA) and the calcium (Ca2+) ionophore A23187. Our results show distinct peroxidase and neutrophil elastase activities in both culture supernatant and NETs. Especially stimulation with A23187 led to pronounced peroxidase and elastase release and yielded high peroxidase activity on the resulting NETs. In contrast to LPS and PMA, A23187 did not induce morphological changes of the nuclei. Histone H3 citrullination was more extensively observed upon induction by A23187 and particularly in LPS- and PMA-induced NETs the detection of citrullinated H3 was dependent on the inhibition of neutrophil proteases, which suggests that NET-associated citrullinated histones are readily cleaved by these proteases. With live cell imaging techniques, differences in the rate of plasma membrane permeabilization were observed, not only for the different inducers, but also among individual neutrophils. LPS and PMA, but not A23187, induced early calcium oscillations and the cytosolic calcium concentrations gradually increased upon LPS and PMA stimulation until the plasma membrane ruptured. The levels of reactive oxygen species rose rapidly after PMA stimulation and much later in neutrophils exposed to LPS and A23187. Taken together, the observed molecular and dynamic differences indicate that NET formation induced by LPS, PMA and A23187 proceeds via different pathways.

Abstract: Hypothalamic leptin receptor (LR) signaling regulates body weight by balancing food intake and energy expenditure. It is well established that the human LR undergoes ectodomain shedding, but little is known about the fate of the remaining cytosolic domain. This study demonstrates that regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) releases the LR intracellular domain (LR ICD), which translocates to the mitochondria where it binds to SOCS6. This LR ICD-SOCS6 interaction stabilizes both proteins on the mitochondrial outer membrane and requires a functional BC box in SOCS6 for mitochondrial association and a central motif in the LR ICD for SOCS6 binding. The LR ICD prevents CCCP-induced mitochondrial depolarization and mitophagy as shown by lowered Parkin translocation and p62 accumulation. Strict regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in the hypothalamus is known to be essential for body weight homeostasis. This is the first study showing that the LR can directly modulate mitochondrial biology.

Abstract: Uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) produces O2− instead of nitric oxide (NO). Earlier, we reported rapamycin, an autophagy inducer and inhibitor of cellular proliferation, attenuated low shear stress (SS) induced O2− production. Nevertheless, it is unclear whether autophagy plays a critical role in the regulation of eNOS uncoupling. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the modulation of autophagy on eNOS uncoupling induced by low SS exposure. We found that low SS induced endothelial O2− burst, which was accompanied by reduced NO release. Furthermore, inhibition of eNOS by L-NAME conspicuously attenuated low SS-induced O2− releasing, indicating eNOS uncoupling. Autophagy markers such as LC3 II/I ratio, amount of Beclin1, as well as ULK1/Atg1 were increased during low SS exposure, whereas autophagic degradation of p62/SQSTM1 was markedly reduced, implying impaired autophagic flux. Interestingly, low SS-induced NO reduction could be reversed by rapamycin, WYE-354 or ATG5 overexpression vector via restoration of autophagic flux, but not by N-acetylcysteine or apocynin. eNOS uncoupling might be ascribed to autophagic flux blockade because phosphorylation of eNOS Thr495 by low SS or PMA stimulation was also regulated by autophagy. In contrast, eNOS acetylation was not found to be regulated by low SS and autophagy. Notably, although low SS had no influence on eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation, whereas boosted eNOS Ser1177 phosphorylation by rapamycin were in favor of the eNOS recoupling through restoration of autophagic flux. Taken together, we reported a novel mechanism for regulation of eNOS uncoupling by low SS via autophagy-mediated eNOS phosphorylation, which is implicated in geometrical nature of atherogenesis.

Abstract: Objective/background
Vitamin D has been increasingly recognized as an immunomodulatory agent. Its deficiency has been associated with immune-mediated diseases such as asthma, rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis. These allergic conditions are dependent on T-helper type 2 (Th2) cells secreting interleukins, overproduction of immunoglobulin E (IgE), and eosinophil activation. We investigated the association between serum vitamin D levels and blood absolute eosinophil count.
Methods
We carried out a cross-sectional study of 669 men and women referred to a clinical pathology laboratory who underwent 25-hydroxyvitamin D testing and complete blood count analysis on the same day.
Results
Vitamin D levels were stratified into four ranges: severely deficient (<10ng/mL), deficient (≥10ng/mL and <20ng/mL), insufficient (≥20ng/mL and <30ng/mL), or sufficient (≥30ng/mL). The mean/median eosinophil count in the four groups was 267/254cells/μL, 245/238cells/μL, 191/159cells/μL, and 182/146cells/μL, respectively, (p=.001). The difference was significant between the severe deficiency group and each of the other three groups (p=.012, p=.002, and p=.001, respectively). There was no statistical difference among the four groups in terms of total leukocyte counts (p=.151), neutrophils (p=.177), or lymphocytes (p=.582).
Conclusion
Vitamin D deficiency was associated with higher blood eosinophil count. These results support the possible role of vitamin D in the eosinophil immune response.

Abstract: Yin Yang 1 (YY1) is a multifunctional transcription factor that can activate or repress transcription depending on the promotor and/or the co-factors recruited. YY1 is phosphorylated in various signaling pathways and is critical for different biological functions including embryogenesis, apoptosis, proliferation, cell-cycle regulation and tumorigenesis. Here we report that YY1 is a substrate for c-Abl kinase phosphorylation at conserved residue Y254 in the spacer region. Pharmacological inhibition of c-Abl kinase by imatinib, nilotinib and GZD824, knock-down of c-Abl using siRNA, and the use of c-Abl kinase-dead drastically reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of YY1. Both radioactive and non-radioactive in vitro kinase assays, as well as co-immunoprecipitation in different cell lines, show that the target of c-Abl phosphorylation is tyrosine residue 254. c-Abl phosphorylation has little effect on YY1 DNA binding ability or cellular localization in asynchronous cells. However, functional studies reveal that c-Abl mediated phosphorylation of YY1 regulates YY1's transcriptional ability in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrate the novel role of c-Abl kinase in regulation of YY1's transcriptional activity, linking YY1 regulation with c-Abl tyrosine kinase signaling pathways.

Abstract: Breast Cancer (BC) is a highly heterogeneous disease whose most aggressive behavior is displayed by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks an efficient targeted therapy. Despite its controversial role, one of the proteins that having been linked with BC is Annexin A1 (AnxA1), which is a Ca+2 binding protein that acts modulating the immune system, cell membrane organization and vesicular trafficking. In this work we analyzed tissue microarrays of BC samples and observed a higher expression of AnxA1 in TNBCs and in lymph node metastasis. We also observed a positive correlation in primary tumors between expression levels of AnxA1 and its receptor, FPR1. Despite displaying a lesser strength, this correlation also exists in BC lymph node metastasis. In agreement, we have found that AnxA1 was highly expressed and secreted in the TNBC cell line MDA-MB-231 that also expressed high levels of FPR1. Furthermore, we demonstrated, by using the specific FPR1 inhibitor Cyclosporin H (CsH) and the immunosuppressive drug Cyclosporin A (CsA), the existence of an autocrine signaling of AnxA1 through the FPR1. Such signaling, elicited by AnxA1 upon its secretion, increased the aggressiveness and survival of MDA-MB-231 cells. In this manner, we demonstrated that CsA works very efficiently as an FPR1 inhibitor. Finally, by using CsA, we demonstrated that FPR1 inhibition decreased MDA-MB-231 tumor growth and metastasis formation in nude mice. These results indicate that FPR1 inhibition could be a potential intervention strategy to manage TNBCs displaying the characteristics of MDA-MB-231 cells. FPR1 inhibition can be efficiently achieved by CsA.

Abstract: Objective/Background
In the absence of high-risk cytogenetic, DNMT3A (DNA Methyltransferase 3a) mutation status has an impact on outcome in the presence of FLT3 (FMS-like Tyrosine Kinase3) and/or NPM1 (Nucleophosmin). In this study, we focus on the features and effect of DNMT3A (R882) mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the presence or absence of NPM1 and FLT3 mutations.
Methods
A total of 174 cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML cases were analyzed for NPM1, FLT3, and DNMT3A mutations. For NPM1 mutation detection, we used the pyrosequencing technique; for FLT3 mutations, polymerase chain reaction and RFLP with ECO-RV techniques were used, and for DNMT3A mutation analysis, we used Sanger sequencing and RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) techniques.
Results
NPM1 mutation was found in 40.80%, DNMT3A in 12.06%, and FLT3 mutation was found in 16.66% of 174 CN-AML patients. We also found seven cases which were (NPM1+, FLT3+), 10 cases which were (NPM1+, DNMT3A+), and two cases were found positive for (DNMT3A+, FLT3+) mutations. Adult patients had significantly higher frequency of NPM1 mutation than children (72.22% vs. 16.66%; p = .020), whereas FLT3/ITD and DNMT3A mutation was associated with higher white blood count (p = .081). Immunophenotypically, NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations were significantly associated with the lack of CD34, whereas FLT3/ITD mutation was positively associated with the expression of CD7. We also assessed the overall survival and progression-free survival of DNMT3A mutation status among patients with CN-AML. Indeed, DNMT3A mutations within the CN-AML subset were associated with significantly shorter overall survival and progression-free survival compared to NPM1 and FLT3 mutated patients (p = .067 and p = .065, respectively).
Conclusion
DNMT3A R882 mutation plays an important role in CN-AML patients’ prognosis and clinical outcomes in the presence and absence of NPM1 and FLT3 mutations.

Abstract: Protein phosphatase 2ACα (PP2ACα), a vital member of the protein phosphatase family, has been studied primarily as a regulator for the development, growth and protein synthesis of a lot of cell types. Dysfunction of PP2ACα protein results in neurodegenerative disease; however, this finding has not been directly confirmed in the mouse model with PP2ACα gene knock-out. Therefore, in this study presented here, we generated the PP2ACα gene knock-out mouse model by the Cre-loxP targeting gene system, with the purpose to directly observe the regulatory role of PP2ACα gene in the development of mouse’s cerebral cortex. We observe that knocking-out PP2ACα gene in the central nervous system (CNS) results in cortical neuronal shrinkage, synaptic plasticity impairments, and learning/memory deficits. Further study reveals that PP2ACα gene knock-out initiates Hippo cascade in cortical neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs), which blocks YAP translocation into the nuclei of NPCs. Notably, p73, directly targeted by Hippo cascade, can bind to the promoter of glutaminase2 (GLS2) that plays a dominant role in the enzymatic regulation of glutamate/glutamine cycle. Finally, we find that PP2ACα gene knock-out inhibits the glutamine synthesis through up-regulating the activity of phosphorylated-p73 in cortical NPCs. Taken together, it concludes that PP2ACα critically supports cortical neuronal growth and cognitive function via regulating the signaling transduction of Hippo-p73 cascade. And PP2ACα indirectly modulates the glutamine synthesis of cortical NPCs through targeting p73 that plays a direct transcriptional regulatory role in the gene expression of GLS2.

Abstract: Scaffold proteins play important roles in regulating signalling network fidelity, the absence of which is often the basis for diseases such as cancer. In the present work, we show that the prototypical scaffold protein Shc is phosphorylated by the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Erk. In addition, Shc threonine phosphorylation is specifically up-regulated in two selected triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines. To explore how Erk-mediated threonine phosphorylation on Shc might play a role in the dysregulation of signalling events, we investigated how Shc affects pathways downstream of EGF receptor. Using an in vitro model and biophysical analysis, we show that Shc threonine phosphorylation is responsible for elevated Akt and Erk signalling, potentially through the recruitment of the 14-3-3 ζ and Pin-1 proteins.

Abstract: An ultrathin Ti film acting as both an intermediate layer and a dopant was inserted at the interface between Mo and Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) to improve the performance of CZTS solar cells. Different from previously reported blocking layers, the Ti intermediate layer inhibited the formation of a MoS2 layer and voids at the interface between the Mo and CZTS absorber and also influenced the crystallinity, surface evenness, Hall mobility, and absorptivity of the CZTS absorber. When the thickness of the Ti blocking layer increased to 20nm, the conversion efficiency of the solar cell increased by 57%, along with an increase in the open-circuit voltage of 32%. The effect of the Ti layer on the microstructure and performance of the CZTS film is discussed here in detail. These results serve as guiding principles for preparing high-quality CZTS thin films for potential applications in low-cost solar cells.

Abstract: The ultra-strong solar irradiance conditions in Qatar area have natural benefits for large-scale solar photovoltaic (PV) farm deployment. However, climate issues such as soiling, extremely high temperatures and sand storms are real challenges for stable performances of solar PV farms. The integration of an energy storage system to the solar farm can be used to smooth the intermittency of the PV power generation. A 500kW/500kWh hybrid solar power generation/storage micro-grid system has been installed in the Solar Test Facility (STF) near Doha, Qatar. In this work, we describe the main elements that constitute the hybrid micro-grid, and the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that has been developed to monitor the different elements of the micro-grid. We give a brief summary of the solar PV performance, analyze the impact of power fluctuations on the quality of the grid and present the data generated from the micro-grid system. We demonstrated a significant improvement of the power quality of the grid with the introduction of an energy storage system to the micro-grid.

Abstract: Transparent composite electrodes (TCE), TiO2/Ag/TiO2 (TAgT), have been demonstrated as a promising alternative of indium tin oxide (ITO) in organic solar cell application. TiO2/Ag/TiO2 have been incorporated into bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) to replace ITO as the anode. Two different hole transfer layers (HTL), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and MoO3, are compared in terms of their compatibility with the TiO2/Ag/TiO2 anode. The MoO3 layer has been shown to be a beneficial HTL for TiO2/Ag/TiO2 based OSC. However, the wettability of MoO3 for polymer blend is not as good as PEDOT:PSS, and results in a relatively thin active layer in OSCs. On the other hand, ITO based OSCs using PEDOT:PSS and MoO3 as the HTL are fabricated as control samples to compare the performance of TAgT and ITO anodes. Results of the investigation shows that the superior electrical property of TAgT anodes contributes to the effective collection of photo-carriers and its lower optical transmittance barely degrades the light absorption in OSCs. In a few words, the higher Haacke figure of merit of TAgT enables better performance of OSCs with MoO3 HTL, in comparison with ITO based OSC.

Abstract: Here, we cloned a new family of four adenylyl cyclase (AC) splice variants from interleukin-1β (IL-1β)-transdifferentiated vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) encoding short forms of AC8 that we have named “AC8E-H”. Using biosensor imaging and biochemical approaches, we showed that AC8E-H isoforms have no cyclase activity and act as dominant-negative regulators by forming heterodimers with other full-length ACs, impeding the traffic of functional units towards the plasma membrane. The existence of these dominant-negative isoforms may account for an unsuspected additional degree of cAMP signaling regulation. It also reconciles the induction of an AC in transdifferentiated VSMCs with the vasoprotective influence of cAMP. The generation of alternative splice variants of ACs may constitute a generalized strategy of adaptation to the cell's environment whose scope had so far been ignored in physiological and/or pathological contexts.

Bcl-xL deamidation is regulated by multiple ion transporters and is intramolecularly catalyzed,

Abstract: In susceptible tumor cells, DNA-damaging antineoplastic agents induce an increase in intracellular pH during the premitochondrial stage of apoptosis. The rate of nonenzymatic deamidation of two asparagines in the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL is accelerated by this increase in pH. Deamidation of these asparagines is a signal for the degradation of Bcl-xL, which is a component of the apoptotic response to DNA damage. It has previously been shown that the increase in pH is mediated by the ion transporter Na+/H+ exchanger 1 in some cells. Here we demonstrate that one or more additional ion transporters also have a role in the regulation of Bcl-xL deamidation in at least some tumor cell lines and fibroblasts. As a second, independent finding, we report that there are histidines in close proximity to the Bcl-xL deamidation sites that are highly conserved in land-dwelling species and we present evidence that deamidation of human Bcl-xL is intramolecularly catalyzed in a manner that is dependent upon these histidines. Further, we present evidence that these histidines act as a pH-sensitive switch that enhances the effect of the increase in pH on the rate of Bcl-xL deamidation. The conservation of such histidines implies that human Bcl-xL is in essence “designed” to be deamidated, which provides further evidence that deamidation serves as a bona fide regulatory post-translational modification of Bcl-xL.

Abstract: GPR84 is a recently de-orphanized member of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family recognizing medium chain fatty acids, and has been suggested to play important roles in inflammation. Due to the lack of potent and selective GPR84 ligands, the basic knowledge related to GPR84 functions is very limited. In this study, we have characterized the GPR84 activation profile and regulation mechanism in human phagocytes, using two recently developed small molecules that specifically target GPR84 agonistically (ZQ16) and antagonistically (GLPG1205), respectively. Compared to our earlier characterization of the short chain fatty acid receptor FFA2R which is functionally expressed in neutrophils but not in monocytes, GPR84 is expressed in both cell types and in monocyte-derived macrophages. In neutrophils, the GPR84 agonist had an activation profile very similar to that of FFA2R. The GPR84-mediated superoxide release was low in naïve cells, but the response could be significantly primed by TNFα and by the actin cytoskeleton disrupting agent Latrunculin A. Similar to that of FFA2R, a desensitization mechanism bypassing the actin cytoskeleton was utilized by GPR84. All ZQ16-mediated cellular responses were sensitive to GLPG1205, confirming the GPR84-dependency. Finally, our data of in vivo transmigrated tissue neutrophils indicate that both GPR84 and FFA2R are involved in neutrophil recruitment processes in vivo. In summary, we show functional similarities but also some important differences between GPR84 and FFA2R in human phagocytes, thus providing some mechanistic insights into GPR84 regulation in blood neutrophils and cells recruited to an aseptic inflammatory site in vivo.

Abstract: The transcription factor Runx1 is an essential regulator of definitive hematopoiesis, megakaryocyte (MK) maturation, and lymphocyte differentiation. Runx1 mutations that interfere with its transcriptional activity are often present in leukemia patients. Recent work demonstrated that the transcriptional activity of Runx1 is regulated by kinase-mediated phosphorylation. In this study, we showed that c-Abl, but not Arg tyrosine kinase, associated with Runx1 both in cultured cells and in vitro. c-Abl-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in the Runx1 transcription inhibition domain negatively regulated the transcriptional activity of Runx1 and inhibited Runx1-mediated MK maturation. Consistent with these findings, increased numbers of MKs were detected in the spleens and bone marrow of abl gene conditional knockout mice. Our findings demonstrate an important role of c-Abl kinase in Runx1-mediated MK maturation and platelet formation and provide a potential mechanism of Abl kinase-regulated hematopoiesis.

Abstract: TNF signaling is directly linked to cancer development and progression. A broad range of tumor cells is able to evade cell death induced by TNF impairing the potential anti-cancer value of TNF in therapy. Although sensitizing cells to TNF-induced death therefore has great clinical implications, detailed mechanistic insights into TNF-mediated human cell death still remain unknown. Here, we analyzed human cells by applying CRISPR/Cas9n to generate cells deficient of IKK1, IKK2, IKK1/2 and RELA. Despite stimulation with TNF resulted in impaired NF-κB activation in all genotypes compared to wildtype cells, increased cell death was observable only in IKK1/2-double-deficient cells. Cell death could be detected by Caspase-3 activation and binding of Annexin V. TNF-induced programmed cell death in IKK1/2−/− cells was further shown to be mediated via RIPK1 in a predominantly apoptotic manner. Our findings demonstrate the IKK complex to protect from TNF-induced cell death in human cells independently to NF-κB RelA suggesting IKK1/2 to be highly promising targets for cancer therapy.

Abstract: Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is an essential process that is mediated by the stepwise appearance or disappearance of many different proteins at the plasma membrane. In the budding yeast, these proteins are categorized into at least five modules, according to their spatiotemporal dynamics. Among them, the dynamics of proteins in the late coat module are well characterized, but those in the early coat module still remain unclear because of the lack of a suitable fluorescent marker with sufficient brightness to allow analysis. To examine the dynamics of early coat proteins, in this study we tagged four representative early coat proteins with 3GFP, and expressed them in a single cell. This cell exhibited a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity of early coat proteins relative to that of each 3GFP-tagged protein. Using this strain, we performed a detailed analysis of early coat proteins, including their precise lifetime, changes in fluorescence intensity, and motility on the plasma membrane. We found that early coat proteins move on the plasma membrane before internalization. Additionally, we expressed these 3GFP-tagged proteins in mutants with deletion of genes related to endocytosis, and found four mutants – end3Δ, las17Δ, sla2Δ, and clc1Δ– in which the lifetime of early coat proteins was markedly increased. Interestingly, deletion of the CLC1 gene dramatically reduced the internalization of early coat proteins whereas internalization of actin patches was largely unchanged, suggesting that the clc1Δ mutant might have a defect in the link between the early coat and actin modules.

Abstract: High thermal performance of microencapsulated phase change material (MEPCM) helps to achieve good solar energy storage behavior. Here, n-dodecanol/melamine resin composite microcapsules modified by graphene oxide (GO) with different oxidation degrees were synthesized, which was applied to study how the oxidation degree of GO influenced the thermal properties of MEPCM. The as-prepared microcapsules were all spherical particles with the average latent heat of 170J/g. TEM analysis showed that MEPCMs with or without GO had obvious core-shell structure with uniform shell thickness. When the dosing of GO was about 0.6wt%, the thermal conductivity of MEPCM/GO with the minimum oxidation degree was enhanced by 115%, while MEPCM/GO with maximum oxidation degree was increased by 72% in thermal conductivity, greatly improving the energy storage efficiency. The result suggested the as-prepared microcapsules with large energy storage capacity and high energy storage efficiency could be a potential material used for solar energy storage.

Abstract: A solution processable, p-type thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-based small organic molecules with appropriate energy levels were employed as hole transport materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The HOMO energy levels of HTMs were tuned to match with methylammonium lead iodide (CH3NH3PbI3) perovskite by incorporating different spacer functional group thiophene, furan, and triphenylamine donor moieties denoted as RTzR (HTM 1), RFTzR (HTM 2) and TPTzR (HTM 3), respectively. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ~ 10.60% was observed for the PSC fabricated with HTM 2. The other fabricated PSCs with HTM 1 and HTM 3 exhibited inferior PCEs of ~ 4.37% and ~ 8.63% respectively. Noticeably, HTM 2 presented a high fill factor with slightly low open circuit voltage (VOC) of ~ 0.955V, which might be related to its low series resistance. Thus, the designed HTM 2 molecule could act as a promising candidate for providing a high efficiency in PSC applications.

Abstract: LMO7 (LIM domain only 7) is a transcription regulator for expression of many Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy-relevant genes, and binds to α-actinin and AF6/afadin at adherens junctions for epithelial cell–cell adhesion. In this study, we found that human LMO7 interacted with the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) protein MAD1. LMO7 colocalized with actin filaments at the cell membrane but did not colocalize with MAD1 at kinetochores in prometaphase. Our observations reveal that overexpression but not depletion of LMO7 caused a SAC defect, and that the LIM domain of LMO7 was a determinant of its ability to interfere with kinetochore localization of the SAC proteins MAD2 and BUBR1 and cause a SAC defect though the LIM peptide itself did neither bind to MAD1, MAD2 and BUBR1 nor localize to the actin filaments. However, overexpression of LMO7 or the LIM peptide did not interfere with kinetochore localization of MAD1. Additionally, overexpression of the LIM peptide prolonged mitotic timing and interfered with chromosome congression whereas that of LMO7b did not. Taken together, we conclude that LMO7 via its LIM domain acts to control mitosis progression and exerts an effect on the SAC.

Abstract: New nickel oxyhydroxide/palladium (NiOOH/Pd) nanocomposites was prepared and showed novel gasochromic characteristics for the first time. The NiOOH microparticles were obtained using the chemical bath synthesis method without stirring for 72h. The synthesized catalytic palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) were added into the NiOOH microparticles and the NiOOH/Pd nanocomposites were readied for gasochromic application. The NiOOH/Pd nanocomposite thin film was obtained by using wet-coating methods. An obviously color change from black state NiOOH to white state Ni(OH)2 was observed after exposed to hydrogen (H2), the maximum transmittance change was 23.2% at 572nm. The white Ni(OH)2 state can be switched back to darken state by exposing to ozone (O3) on the thin film with its novel gasochromic property. Surface electron microscopy (SEM) images showed special surface morphology of NiOOH/Pd before and after gas treatments. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was used to confirm the changes in chemical bonding before/after gas treatment. XRD patterns and FT-IR spectra indicated the structure changes that occurred during film preparation and before/after exposed to H2.

Abstract: Pleural fibrosis is barely reversible and the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) which have apical-basal polarity play a key role in pleural fibrosis. Loss of cell polarity is involved in the development of fibrotic diseases. Partition defective protein (PAR) complex is a key regulator of cell polarity. However, changes of PMC polarity and PAR complex in pleural fibrosis are still unknown. In this study, we observed that PMC polarity was lost in fibrotic pleura. Next we found increased Lethal (2) giant larvae (Lgl) bound with aPKC and PAR-6B competing against PAR-3A in PAR complex, which led to cell polarity loss. Then we demonstrated that Lgl1 siRNA prevented cell polarity loss in PMCs, and Lgl1 conditional knockout (ER-Cre+/−Lgl1flox/flox) attenuated pleural fibrosis in a mouse model. Our data indicated that Lgl1 regulates cell polarity of PMCs, inhibition of Lgl1 and maintenance of cell polarity in PMCs could be a potential therapeutic treatment approach for pleural fibrosis.

Abstract: NRBE3 acts as an E3 ligase of RB to promote RB's polyubiquitination and degradation. In addition, NRBE3 is up-regulated in human breast cancer (BC) tissues. However, how NRBE3 functions in BC is unknown. Here, we show that up-regulation of NRBE3 is correlated with lymphatic metastasis in human BC tissues. Ectopic expression of NRBE3 promotes migration and invasion in BC cells. Accordingly, knockdown of NRBE3 inhibits migration and invasion in BC cells. Depletion of NRBE3 inhibits lung metastasis of BC cells in vivo. Knock-down of NRBE3 causes increase of E-cadherin protein levels. Interestingly, Flag-NRBE3 decreases E-cadherin level in RB-expressing and RB-null BC cells, demonstrating that there exist RB-independent mechanisms for NRBE3-mediated E-cadherin expression regulation. However, the E3 ligase deficient deletion mutant Flag-NRBE3 (ΔU-box) modestly decreases E-cadherin level in RB-expressing cells, indicating that NRBE3 controls E-cadherin expression mainly through RB-dependent pathways in RB-expressing cells. We further demonstrate that NRBE3 inhibits the transcription of E-cadherin in BC cells. Significantly, NRBE3 expression is negatively correlated with E-cadherin expression in human BC tissues and cell lines. Collectively, we demonstrate that NRBE3 promotes metastasis of BC and possesses the potential as a therapeutic target in BC.

Abstract: Latent heat thermal energy storage system using phase change materials was widely used in solar thermal systems. Here, a novel form-stable phase change composite was successfully prepared. The sebacic acid is encapsulated by carbon nanotube sponge. The as-prepared composite is determined by SEM, FT-IR and XRD and the results show that the paraffin is mostly encapsulated in the pores of carbon nanotube sponge. The DSC measurements indicate that the melting temperature and latent heat of the composite are 121.1°C and 131.8Jg−1, respectively. The phase change composite could maintain its phase transition perfectly after 200 melting−freezing cycles, and no leakage of sebacic acid was observed by further SEM observation. The as-prepared composite shows 27-fold thermal conductivity enhancement as compared to the pure sebacic acid. Further, the as-prepared composite shows great photo-thermal performance when under simulated solar irradiation. Hence, the carbon nanotube sponge based high temperature phase change composite has great potential in solar thermal application.

Abstract: GSK3β interacting protein (GSKIP) is a naturally occurring negative regulator of GSK3β and retains both the Protein Kinase A Regulatory subunit binding (PKA-RII) domain and GSK3β interacting domain. Of these two domains, we found that PKA-RII is required for forming a working complex comprising PKA/GSKIP/GSK3β/Drp1 to influence phosphorylation of Drp1 Ser637. In this study, bioinformatics and experimental explorations re-analyzing GSKIP's biofunctions suggest that the evolutionarily conserved Domain of Unknown Function (DUF727) is an ancestral prototype of GSKIP in prokaryotes, and acquired the C-terminal GSK3β binding site (tail) in invertebrates except for Saccharomyces spp., after which the N-terminal PKA-RII binding region (head) evolved in vertebrates. These two regions mutually influence each other and modulate GSKIP binding to GSK3β in yeast two-hybrid assays and co-immunoprecipitation. Molecular modeling showed that mammalian GSKIP could form a dimer through the L130 residue (GSK3β binding site) rather than V41/L45 residues. In contrast, V41/L45P mutant facilitated a gain-of-function effect on GSKIP dimerization, further influencing binding behavior to GSK3β compared to GSKIP wild-type (wt). The V41/L45 residues are not only responsible for PKA RII binding that controls GSK3β activity, but also affect dimerization of GSKIP monomer, with net results of gain-of-function in GSKIP-GSK3β interaction. In addition to its reported role in modulating Drp1, Ser637 phosphorylation caused mitochondrial elongation; we postulated that GSKIP might be involved in the Wnt signaling pathway as a scavenger to recruit GSK3β away from the β-catenin destruction complex and as a competitor to compete for GSK3β binding, resulting in accumulation of S675 phosphorylated β-catenin.

Abstract: Ultra-thin a-Si:H p-i-n solar cell has been proposed as advance to form three-dimensional structures on nano-structured substrates for achieving optically thick and electrically thin solar cells. However, over the years, although extensive studies have been carried out, no high efficiency was achieved yet. We found that not only the short circuit current density (Jsc) decreases, but also the open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) decreases with the reduction of i-layer thickness, which is opposite to the expectation. We investigated the possible root-causes for this unusual phenomenon and speculated the direct recombination of the electrons in the n-layer and the holes in the p-layer by tunneling through the thin i-layer is the main reason for the reduced Voc and FF in ultra-thin solar cells. Furthermore, the absorption in the doped layers is the most critical limitation for ultra-thin silicon solar cell efficiency because the doped layer thickness becomes comparable to the intrinsic layer. To resolve this issue, we used nanocrystalline silicon oxide (nc-SiOx:H) doped layers with a wide bandgap to reduce the parasitic absorption in the doped layers and the highly asymmetric conductivity improves the carrier collection and made a significant improvement in the cell efficiency. We achieved 8.79%, 7.65%, and 5.32% efficiencies with the i-layer thickness of only 70nm, 50nm and 20nm, respectively, which are the highest ones in ultra-thin silicon solar cells.

Abstract: Cytokinesis begins in anaphase with the formation of the central spindle. PRC1 is a microtubule associated protein that plays an essential role in central spindle formation by crosslinking antiparallel microtubules. We have identified PRC1 as a novel binding partner for p27Kip1 (p27). p27 is a cyclin-CDK inhibitor that causes cell cycle arrest in G1. However, p27 has also been involved in the regulation of G2/M progression and cytokinesis, as well as of other cellular processes, including actin and microtubule cytoskeleton dynamics. We found that p27 interferes with the ability of PRC1 to bind to microtubules, without affecting PRC1 dimerization or its capacity to interact with other partners such as KIF4. In this way, p27 inhibited microtubule bundling by PRC1 in vitro and prevented the extensive microtubule bundling phenotype caused by PRC1 overexpression in cells in culture. Finally, co-expression of p27 or a p27 mutant that does not bind cyclin-CDKs inhibited multinucleation induced by PRC1 overexpression. Together, our results suggest that p27 may participate in the regulation of mitotic progression in a CDK-independent manner by modulating PRC1 activity.

Abstract: The ability of printed organic solar cells (OSCs) to survive repeated mechanical deformation is critical to large-scale implementation. This paper reports an investigation into the mechanical stability of OSCs through bending and torsion testing of whole printed modules. Two types of modules are used that differ slightly in thickness as well as on the basis of the electrode materials: silver nanowires or carbon-based inks. Each type of module is subjected to two different mechanical modes of deformation, bending and torsion, of several thousand cycles per module using a purpose-built robotic device. Analysis of the distribution of stress in the devices performed by finite-element modeling predicts the locations of failure. Failure upon bending originates at the laser-cut edges of the modules from shear at the clamp/module interface leading to crazing of the plastic barrier encapsulant foils. This crazing leads to eventual delamination due first to decohesion of the active layer at the edge of the modules and later to deadhesion between the PEDOT:PSS (electrode) and P3HT:PCBM (semiconductor) layers. The torsion mode imposes greater stresses than the bending mode and thus leads to failure at fewer strain cycles. Failure during torsion occurs through crack propagation initiated at stress concentrations on the edges of the module that were imposed by their rectangular geometry and ultimately leads to bifurcation of the entire module. Rather than the differences in electrode materials, the differences in survivability between the two types of modules are attributed mostly to the thickness of the substrate materials used, with the thinner substrate used in the carbon-based modules (~160µm) failing at fewer strain cycles than the substrate used in the silver-nanowire-based modules (~190µm). Taken together, the results suggest ways in which the lifetimes of devices can be extended by the layouts of modules and choices of materials.

Abstract: Lung cancer is considered one of the most frequent causes of cancer-related death worldwide and Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 80% of all lung cancer cases. Autophagy is a cellular process responsible for the recycling of damaged organelles and protein aggregates. Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ1) is involved in Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and autophagy induction in different cancer models and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. It is not clear how autophagy can regulate EMT in NSCLC cells. In the present study, we have investigated the regulatory role of autophagy in EMT induction in NSCLC and show that TGFβ1 can simultaneously induce both autophagy and EMT in the NSCL lines A549 and H1975. Upon chemical inhibition of autophagy using Bafilomycin-A1, the expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin and N-cadherin was reduced. Immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry (ICC) showed that the mesenchymal marker vimentin was significantly downregulated upon TGFβ1 treatment in ATG7 knockdown cells when compared to corresponding cells treated with scramble shRNA (negative control), while E-cadherin was unchanged. Furthermore, autophagy inhibition (Bafilomycin A1 and ATG7 knockdown) decreased two important mesenchymal functions, migration and contraction, of NSCLC cells upon TGFβ1 treatment. This study identified a crucial role of autophagy as a potential positive regulator of TGFβ1-induced EMT in NSCLC cells and identifies inhibitors of autophagy as promising new drugs in antagonizing the role of EMT inducers, like TGFβ1, in the clinical progression of NSCLC.

Abstract: The role of mitochondria is emerging in regulation of innate immunity, inflammation and cell death beyond its primary role in energy metabolism. Mitochondria act as molecular platform for immune adaptor protein complexes, which participate in innate immune signaling. The mitochondrial localized immune adaptors are widely expressed in non-immune cells, however their role in regulation of mitochondrial function and metabolic adaption is not well understood. NLRX1, a member of NOD family receptor proteins, localizes to mitochondria and is a negative regulator of anti-viral signaling. However, the submitochondrial localization of NLRX1 and its implication in regulation of mitochondrial functions remains elusive. Here, we confirm that NLRX1 translocates to mitochondrial matrix and associates with mitochondrial FASTKD5 (Fas-activated serine-threonine kinase family protein-5), a bonafide component of mitochondrial RNA granules (MRGs). The association of NLRX1 with FASTKD5 negatively regulates the processing of mitochondrial genome encoded transcripts for key components of complex-I and complex-IV, to modulate its activity and supercomplexes formation. The evidences, here, suggest an important role of NLRX1 in regulating the post-transcriptional processing of mitochondrial RNA, which may have an important implication in bioenergetic adaptation during metabolic stress, oncogenic transformation and innate immunity.

Abstract: Inositol polyphosphate 4 phosphatase type I enzyme (INPP4A) has a well-documented function in the cytoplasm where it terminates the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) pathway by acting as a negative regulator. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that INPP4A shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Nuclear INPP4A is enzymatically active and in dynamic equilibrium between the nucleus and cytoplasm depending on the cell cycle stage, with highest amounts detected in the nucleus during the G0/G1 phase. Moreover, nuclear INPP4A is found to have direct proliferation suppressive activity. Cells constitutively overexpressing nuclear INPP4A exhibit massive apoptosis. In human tissues as well as cell lines, lower nuclear localization of INPP4A correlate with cancerous growth. Together, our findings suggest that nuclear compartmentalization of INPP4A may be a mechanism to regulate cell cycle progression, proliferation and apoptosis. Our results imply a role for nuclear-localized INPP4A in tumor suppression in humans.

Abstract: Little work has been reported on the performance improvement of the β-CIGS solar cell itself even though the β-CIGS phase can have an ideal band gap for high-conversion efficiency solar cells. We incorporated Na2S to β-CIGS film by supplying Na2S to three different stages: on the (In,Ga)2Se3 layer, on the α-CIGS layer, and on the β -CIGS layer in the three-stage co-evaporation process. The purpose of Na2S incorporation was to control the carrier concentration and passivate grain boundaries in β–CIGS film. With Na2S incorporation on the β–CIGS surface, both the Cu and Se concentrations at the β–CIGS surface were greatly reduced and the Na-depleted subsurface area that existed in the referenced β–CIGS film without Na2S was eliminated. The carrier concentration determined at 100kHz was lowest with Na2S incorporation on the β–CIGS surface, while that determined at 1MHz was similar with various Na2S supply stages. The open-circuit voltage and fill factor greatly increased in the β–CIGS solar cell with the Na2S incorporation. The cell conversion efficiency with Na2S incorporation on the β-CIGS layer improved from 10.3% to 14.2% without AR coating, which is a record efficiency in β-CIGS solar cells at this time.

Abstract: The nucleolar protein hUTP14a promotes p53 degradation and possesses an oncogene potential. Here, we report that hUTP14a promotes degradation of tumor suppressor retinoblastoma (RB) protein. Sequences alignment showed that hUTP14a contains the RB-binding PENF motif in its C-terminus. We showed that hUTP14a interacted with RB in vivo and in vitro. Further, hUTP14a promoted polyubiquitination and proteasome-dependent turnover of RB. Importantly, purified Flag-hUTP14a facilitated RB ubiquitination in vitro, demonstrating that hUTP14a is an ubiquitin E3 ligase for RB. A BLAST alignment with hUTP14a does not reveal a RING or HECT domain. To define the conserved domain for E3 ligase activity in hUTP14a, the minimum domain for promoting RB degradation was mapped to residues 61–120 of hUTP14a, in which a leucine-rich region (LRR) LxLxxLL was suggested to be conserved. Flag-hUTP14a (ΔLRR), Flag-hUTP14a-MT1(LxLxxLL to LxLxxAA) and Flag-hUTP14a-MT2(LxLxxLL to AxAxxAA) lost the capability of ubiquitinating RB in vitro, demonstrating that LRR is required for the E3 ligase activity of hUTP14a. Consequently, expression of hUTP14a caused upregulation of E2F1 downstream genes, thus promoting cancer cell proliferation. Taken together, we demonstrate that hUTP14a promotes RB degradation through its E3 ligase activity and suggest that the LRR could be a potential conserved E3 ligase domain.

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) cell/module/array temperature calculations are essential to accurately assess its electrical performance. In this paper, we developed and validated two new models, and then we focused on the comparison of ten theoretical models (including our models) with experimental measurements, based on the ambient temperature, the in-plane array irradiance with/without taking into account the wind speed. These models were used to determine the PV module temperature of a 7.2kWp standalone photovoltaic power plant installed in Elkaria village (Province of Essaouira, Morocco). The results show that our model without wind yields the highest value of the correlation coefficient R2=96.7% and the lowest value of the root mean square error RMSE=1.6°C among the models without wind. On the other hand, our model with wind gives the best statistical coefficients (R2=98.8% and RMSE=1.1°C) compared to all models (with/without wind).

Abstract: Mitochondria play essential metabolic functions in eukaryotes. Although their major role is the generation of energy in the form of ATP, they are also involved in maintenance of cellular redox state, conversion and biosynthesis of metabolites and signal transduction. Most mitochondrial functions are conserved in eukaryotic systems and mitochondrial dysfunctions trigger several human diseases. By using multi-omics approach, we investigate the effect of methionine supplementation on yeast cellular metabolism, considering its role in the regulation of key cellular processes. Methionine supplementation induces an up-regulation of proteins related to mitochondrial functions such as TCA cycle, electron transport chain and respiration, combined with an enhancement of mitochondrial pyruvate uptake and TCA cycle activity. This metabolic signature is more noticeable in cells lacking Snf1/AMPK, the conserved signalling regulator of energy homeostasis. Remarkably, snf1Δ cells strongly depend on mitochondrial respiration and suppression of pyruvate transport is detrimental for this mutant in methionine condition, indicating that respiration mostly relies on pyruvate flux into mitochondrial pathways. These data provide new insights into the regulation of mitochondrial metabolism and extends our understanding on the role of methionine in regulating energy signalling pathways.

Abstract: Band tailing is a major contributing factor to the large open circuit voltage (Voc) deficit that is currently limiting Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) photovoltaic devices. It occurs in highly doped, highly compensated semiconductors and gives rise to a non-uniform electronic band structure. Here we report spatially resolved fluctuations in CZTS optical properties using low temperature cathodoluminescence (CL) in a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Principal component analysis reveals three CL peaks whose relative intensity vary across domains ~ 100nm in size. It is not known whether the non-uniform optical properties are due to changes in composition or due to structural order-disorder at constant composition. Measurement of composition with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis in an SEM and ordering with Micro-Raman mapping revealed CZTS to be uniform within the spatial resolution (estimated at ~ 0.4µm and 1.1µm respectively) and sensitivity of the two techniques. The CL results are consistent with the presence of band tailing in CZTS.

Abstract: Calcium (Ca2+) release from the endoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in many cell-fate defining cellular processes. Traditionally, this Ca2+ release was associated with the ER Ca2+ release channels, inositol 1,4,5‑triphosphate receptor (IP3R) and ryanodine receptor (RyR). Lately, however, other calcium conductances have been found to be intracellularly localized and to participate in cell fate regulation. Nonetheless, molecular identity and functional properties of the ER Ca2+ release mechanisms associated with multiple diseases, e.g. prostate cancer, remain unknown. Here we identify a new family of transient receptor potential melastatine 8 (TRPM8) channel isoforms as functional ER Ca2+ release channels expressed in mitochondria-associated ER membranes (MAMs). These TRPM8 isoforms exhibit an unconventional structure with 4 transmembrane domains (TMs) instead of 6 TMs characteristic of the TRP channel archetype. We show that these 4TM-TRPM8 isoforms form functional channels in the ER and participate in regulation of the steady-state Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]) in mitochondria and the ER. Thus, our study identifies 4TM-TRPM8 isoforms as ER Ca2+ release mechanism distinct from classical Ca2+ release channels.

Abstract: As a very promising thermochromic material, VO2 (M/R) (Monoclinic/Rutile) has not been widely applied in smart windows due to its intrinsic low solar modulation (ΔTsol) and low luminous transmission (Tlum). To address this issue, porous structures have been introduced into the VO2 film. Herein, mesoporous VO2 powders with pore size of about 2–10nm were synthesized using cotton as template by hydrothermal methods. The pore and crystal size of the synthesized VO2 powders can be reliably controlled by the hydrothermal temperature. The mesoporous VO2 powders were mixed with PVP to prepare the VO2-based nanocomposite films by spin coating. The VO2-based films show a better performance between ΔTsol and Tlum than that appeared in previous reports. Especially, a larger pore size could lead to a higher visible transmittance and a larger crystal size would facilitate the enhancement in the solar modulation. In this sense, the VO2-based film obtained at the hydrothermal temperature of 180°C exhibits an outstanding thermochromic performance with ΔTsol of 12.9% and Tlum up to 56.0% due to a larger crystal size and pore size. Therefore, this synthetic route shows a potential method for the application of mesoporous VO2 powders for solar control coatings.

Abstract: Indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode was modified with triethyoxy-2-thienylsilane (TETS), and then the polythiothene (PT) film covalently bonded to ITO electrode (PT-ITO) was prepared by the electrochemical polymerization. It was found that the adsorption force of PT on ITO electrode was enhanced, PT-ITO exhibited better stability. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and UV–vis spectroscopy measurements indicated that the doping/dedoping reproducibility of PT-ITO in electrolyte was good. When the applied potential was 0V, PT-ITO exhibited red color. While the positive potential was higher enough, PT-ITO exhibited grey-blue color, and the color change of PT-ITO was reversible. Moreover, PT film on ITO substrate chemically modified with TETS (T-ITO) was used to successfully fabricate an electrochromic (EC) device that exhibited stable EC switching as a function of applied potential. This again demonstrated that chemical bonding approach could bring about stronger interactions between the PT and ITO substrate, improving the EC properties.

Abstract: Realization of high efficiency III-V-on-Si solar cells requires preparation of an oxygen free Si substrate surface, which allows for subsequent antiphase domain free III-V epitaxy. For GaAsP/Si tandem cells, the impact of As on established Si processing in metal organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE) is essential. Here, we study the interaction of As with vicinal Si(100) surfaces, the formation of atomically well-ordered As-modified Si(100) surfaces, and its impact on subsequently grown GaP epilayers. We apply optical in situ spectroscopy during MOVPE and show that process routes strongly affect the formation of double-layer steps on Si(100). We demonstrate that exposure to As, together with HF pre-treatment, enables processing of suitable Si(100) 2° and 6° offcut surfaces at temperatures below 820°C. Subsequently grown GaP epilayers exhibit smooth surfaces free of antiphase disorder and distinct Laue oscillations in X-ray diffraction. Such low temperature processing, which is controllable in situ, is promising for further metamorphic GaAsP integration.

Abstract: Optineurin (Optn) is an autophagy receptor that performs various functions in cargo-selective and non-selective autophagy. Here, we have identified and characterized a splice variant of mouse optineurin mRNA, which produces a truncated protein lacking N-terminal 157 amino acids (d157mOptn). This mRNA and protein are expressed in several tissues and cells. d157mOptn has an intact LC3-interacting region and a serine (S187) in it. However, unlike normal optineurin, the d157mOptn was not phosphorylated at this site when expressed in mammalian cells, and showed reduced interaction with TBK1 (tank binding kinase) that mediates phosphorylation at S187 (S177 in human OPTN). This phosphorylation of Optn required intact N-terminal sequence as well as functional C-terminal ubiquitin-binding domain. Unlike normal optineurin, d157mOptn was unable to promote autophagosome and autolysosome formation upon expression in Optn-deficient cells. d157mOptn was recruited to mutant huntingtin aggregates, but unlike wild type optineurin, it was unable to clear these aggregates by autophagy in neuronal NSC-34 cells. Phospho-TBK1 was seen around mutant Huntingtin aggregates in Optn overexpressing cells but it was reduced in cells overexpressing d157mOptn. Thus, we have identified an isoform of mouse optineurin which is defective in cargo-selective and non-selective autophagy possibly due to loss of phosphorylation and impaired interaction with TBK1. This isoform, which inhibits autophagosome formation in neuronal cells, might be involved in selectively modulating some of the functions of Optn, such as autophagy. Our results provide an insight into the role of N-terminal domain of Optn in various autophagic functions.

Abstract: Brown adipocytes (BAs) exhibit an energy-expending signature that is important in balancing metabolic homeostasis. In this study, results of transcriptome analyses revealed the reprogrammed splicing profile of the PR domain containing 16 (PRDM16) gene, a key transcription factor involved in brown adipogenesis, throughout development of wild-type brown adipose tissues (BATs). Moreover, discriminative splicing patterns of PRDM16 transcripts were noted in embryonic and postnatal RBM4a−/− BATs. Overexpression of RBM4a enhanced the relative levels of PRDM16-ex 16 transcripts by simultaneously interacting with exonic and intronic CU elements, which encoded the PRDM16S isoform containing a distinct C-terminus. The presence of the overexpressed PRDM16S isoform showed a stronger effect than the overexpressed PRDM16L isoform on enhancing transcriptional activity of the RBM4a and the PGC-1α promoter. Overexpression of the PRDM16S isoform exerted more-prominent effects on enhancing the BAT-related gene program and energy expenditure compared to those of PRDM16L-overexpressing cells. Our studies demonstrated that RBM4a-regulated alternative splicing constituted another regulatory mechanism for strengthening the influence of PRDM16 on the development of brown adipocytes.

Abstract: Inkjet printing is a promising route for thin film deposition due to its low material wastage and potential of high throughput production. In this work, the inkjet printing technique is used for the deposition of Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 (CZTSSe) thin films from Cu-Zn-Sn-S molecular inks. The key step for using the inkjet printing technique is to formulate a stable ink with suitable viscosity. The ink was prepared by dissolving Cu, Sn, and Zn metal salt precursors, thiourea and different amount of NaF (varied from 0M to 1.12M) in dimethyl sulfoxide. NaF was added to verify the influence of sodium (Na) in ink formation and CZTSSe device properties. It was found from the kesterite structure analysis that increasing NaF leads to segregation of a NaCl phase in the resulting CZTSSe films. Cross-sectional morphologies of the kesterite layer as revealed by scanning electron microscopy showed an enhancement from a multi-layered sandwich type to a double-layered structure by adding NaF. The photoelectron conversion efficiencies of solar cells, with a glass/Mo/CZTSSe/CdS/ZnO/AZO/Ni-Al configuration, increased from 1.7% to 6.4% with increasing NaF concentration from 0M to 0.144M and thereafter decreasing at higher NaF concentration (≥ 0.288M).

Abstract: In this work, the compatibility of low-Cr carbon steel A516.Gr70 and stainless steels AISI 304 and AISI 316 with NaNO3-KNO3-Ca(NO3)2 (15–43–42wt%) molten salt known as HitecXL was evaluated with the aim of determination the most suitable constructive material for a pilot thermocline thermal energy storage (TES) system of 20MWh, which is under development for a commercial pilot concentrated solar power (CSP) plant of 1 MWe constructed at Green Energy Park in Ben Guerir in Morocco. It has been shown that the imperfection of initial state (roughness, exposure to atmosphere, surface defects) of carbon steel and humidity of the salt, inherent conditions of real applications, play a crucial role in the ability of the material to withstand corrosion attack of the molten HitecXL salt. The corrosion rates determined for studied materials allowed to select an appropriate low cost material with the highest corrosion resistance to be used for construction of the TES tank. New insights into the corrosion process of stainless and carbon steels by the nitrate salt have been made using a combination of different techniques, such as: SEM, EDX, XPS and XRD.

Abstract: Human placental extract contains numerous bioactive components that are effective wound healing, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents. During our investigation on the therapeutic potency of human placental extract, we have purified ubiquitin-like molecules that showed strong fibrino(geno)lytic activity. Further investigation confirmed similar potency of ubiquitin purified from adult human erythrocyte. Additionally, ubiquitin efficiently degraded disordered amyloid β 42 peptide (Aβ42) aggregate and fibrin-Aβ42 co-aggregate in vitro and reduced co-aggregate induced cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells as compared to plasmin. Ubiquitin also degraded abnormal co-aggregates of fibrin with other plasma proteins such as fibronectin, albumin, lysozyme, tranthyretin and α-synuclein. To elucidate the mechanism of degradation, synthetic peptides (ADG, GKT, DQQ, QRL, LIF, AGK, HLVL) derived from ubiquitin template as well as synthetic ubiquitin (8565.32 Da) were employed. Synthetic ubiquitin completely degraded preformed Aβ 42 aggregate and fibrin-Aβ42 co-aggregate, whereas, the smaller synthetic peptides showed varying degrees of degradation. These observations attribute a novel function of ubiquitin that may be used for degrading abnormal fibrin clots in human body. Thorough investigation might unfold a novel molecular mechanism of ubiquitin in protein homeostasis.

Abstract: Electrochromic-based optical modulation devices have attracted much interest because of potential application for electric papers and smart windows. We have reported Ag deposition-based optical modulation device which showed reversible changes of optical states between clear transparent and silver-mirror. In the device, formation of silver halide complexes greatly affected the optical states of silver electrodeposit. In this research, the effects of silver halide complexes were investigated by changing halide anion species in terms of the optical properties of the EC devices. The stability of the silver halide complex induced change in reduction voltage to form silver nanoparticles. Diffusion coefficients and electrode reaction rates also have effects on morphology of deposited Ag nanoparticles and resulting optical properties.

Abstract: In this work, the composition of oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) thin films was investigated. The films were prepared by reactive sputter deposition, and were found for have oxygen contents on the order of several tens of per cents. We present depth-resolved atomic composition profiles of photochromic YHO films to study the connection between composition, photochromic properties and growth parameters. Two films, deposited at different pressures, were prepared and characterized using ion beam analysis techniques, i.e. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and elastic recoil detection analysis. We found that an increase of deposition pressure results in larger [O]/[Y] ratios, while the ratio [H]/[Y] becomes reduced. We also report a gradual oxidation of the films exposed to air as well as hydrogen release under ion bombardment.

Abstract: Molten salt is an important heat storage and heat transfer medium in solar thermal power generation technology due to its high heat capacity, wide working temperature range, and low cost. Adding nanoparticles (usually by the two-step method with ultrasonic dispersion) can increase the specific heat of molten salt. Thus, the molten salt nanofluids can increase the heat capacity and decrease the heat storage cost of a solar thermal power generation system. However, nanoparticles are easy to agglomerate in the molten salt; moreover, after agglomeration, the performance of molten salt nanofluids is degraded. A two-step method with high-temperature melting in preparing molten salt nanofluids is proposed in this paper. Molten salt nanofluids were prepared by high-temperature melting. The base solution was a low-melting point molten salt and the nanoparticles were SiO2 with a diameter of 20nm. The specific heat was measured and the nanoparticle dispersity was analyzed. The stability of the molten salt nanofluids was studied, and the results were compared with those prepared by ultrasonic dispersion. The average specific heat of molten salt nanofluids prepared by high-temperature melting was 1.789J/(g·K), which was close to that of molten salt nanofluids prepared by ultrasonic dispersion and 16.4% higher than that of pure molten salt. The molten salt nanofluids prepared by ultrasonic dispersion showed poor thermal stability under high-temperature conditions, and the average specific heat decreased by 8.5% after only 200h. The thermal stability of molten salt nanofluids prepared by high-temperature melting showed a highly stable performance in long-time experiments. The variation of specific heat was less than 5% after 2000h under the same high-temperature experimental condition. The molten salt nanofluids obtained by high-temperature melting showed better stability and long performance than those obtained by ultrasonic dispersion. Therefore, the two-step method with high-temperature melting is stable and reliable for preparing molten salt nanofluids.

Abstract: N-acyl-dopamines are endolipids with neuroprotective, antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. Previously, we showed the ability of these compounds to induce HIF-1α stabilization. Hypoxia and HIF-1α play an important role in the most relevant stages of diabetic pathogenesis. This work analyzes the possible role of these molecules on beta cell differentiation, insulin production and diabetic foot ulcer. Hypoxia response pathway has been characterized in beta-cell differentiation in rat pancreatic acinar cell line and human islet-derived precursor cells. Protein and mRNA expression of key proteins in this process have been analyzed, as well as those involved in beta cells reprogramming. The effect of N-acyl-dopamines on hypoxia response pathway, beta cells reprogramming and insulin production have been studied in both cell types, as well as its role in angiogenesis models in vitro and wound closure in type 2 diabetic mice. Our results show how the hypoxia response pathway is altered during beta cells differentiation, accompanied by an induction of the transcription factor HIF-1α. We demonstrate how some N-acyl-dopamines induce beta cell differentiation and insulin production in two different cell models. In parallel, these endolipids promote angiogenesis in vitro and wound closure in type 2 diabetic mice. These results provide a biological mechanism through which some endolipids could induce beta cell differentiation. We demonstrate how N-acyl-dopamines can modulate insulin production and, in parallel, reverse HIF-1α inhibition in a wound healing model in diabetic mice. Therefore, the potential use of the pharmacological modulation of N-acyl-dopamines may have implications for diabetes prevention and treatment strategies.

Abstract: MicroRNAs are small endogenous non-coding RNAs, which can frequently emerge as regulators in many cancer types. MiR-1290 was found to be abnormally elevated in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the underlying molecular mechanism still needs to be investigated. Here, we demonstrated that miR-1290 expression levels were remarkably upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Higher miR-1290 expression levels positively associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced tumor stage. Functional assays showed that upregulated miR-1290 expression in NSCLC cells enhanced cell proliferation, cell colony formation and invasion capacities in vitro. Furthermore, we found that miR-1290 promoted cell proliferation related protein CDK2 and CDK4 expression and enhanced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) process by downregulating E-cadherin expression and upregulating N-cadherin expression. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter gene assays revealed that Interferon regulatory factor 2 (IRF2) was a direct target of miR-1290. Overexpression of miR-1290 can degrade IRF2 mRNA and downregulated IRF2 protein expression in NSCLC cells. Upregulated IRF2 could partly rescue the promoting effects induced by miR-1290 overexpression on cell proliferation and invasion of NSCLC. Additionally, we confirmed that reduced miR-1290 expression could suppress tumor growth using a tumor xenograft model in vivo. Thus, we concluded that miR-1290 may serve as a potential target of NSCLC treatment.

Abstract: This article reports on the studies of InGaN Nanowires (InGaN NWs) prepared via metal- assisted photochemical electroless etching method with Pt as catalyser. It has been found that etching time greatly influences the growth of InGaN NWs. The density and the length of nanowires are increased for longer etching time and excellent substrate coverage was observed. The synthesis mechanism of InGaN NWs using metal assisted photochemical electroless etching method and the energy band diagram were presented. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements of InGaN NWs shows a red-shift PL peaks compared to the as grown associated to the relaxation of compressive stress. Furthermore, Raman measurements shows a large shift of 20cm−2 of the A1(LO) modes, which is strongly related to the In composition. The Raman results confirm the reduction of the In composition in the epilayer due to the etching process and formation of nanowires. Therefore, the observed large shift to the lower frequency in Raman spectra confirms the stress relaxation. This new and low-cost etching method to synthesize strain relaxed InGaN NWs will be suitable for III-nitride solar cell applications.

Abstract: Far-red and near-infrared emitting chromophores extend applications of fluorescent proteins to regions of maximal transmission of most tissues, but present considerable engineering challenges. Far-red adapting cyanobacteria generate a novel set of biliproteins. One of them, ApcF2, from a thermophilic cyanobacterium was subjected to structure-guided, site-directed random and specific mutagenesis, and was screened for bright far-red emission. We report the generation of chromoproteins, termed BDFPs, that are small, bind auto-catalytically the ubiquitous biliverdin as chromophore, express well, and retain their fluorescence in mammalian cells and in the nematode, C. elegans. They are, moreover, photostable and tolerate high temperature, low pH and chemical denaturation. Homo-bichromophoric tandems of these proteins improve labeling, while hetero-bichromophoric systems with large Stokes shifts are suitable for applications like FRET, multi-channel or super-resolution microscopy. The BDFPs compare favorably to other biliproteins and provide a novel, extremely versatile labeling tool-box.

Abstract: Mutations in CLN5 cause neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL), a currently untreatable neurodegenerative disorder commonly known as Batten disease. Several genetic models have been generated to study the function of CLN5, but one limitation has been the lack of a homolog in lower eukaryotic model systems. Our previous work revealed a homolog of CLN5 in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum. We used a Cln5-GFP fusion protein to show that the protein is secreted and functions as a glycoside hydrolase in Dictyostelium. Importantly, we also revealed this to be the molecular function of human CLN5. In this study, we generated an antibody against Cln5 to show that the endogenous protein is secreted during the early stages of Dictyostelium development. Like human CLN5, the Dictyostelium homolog is glycosylated and requires this post-translational modification for secretion. Cln5 secretion bypasses the Golgi complex, and instead, occurs via an unconventional pathway linked to autophagy. Interestingly, we observed co-localization of Cln5 and GFP-Cln3 as well as increased secretion of Cln5 and Cln5-GFP in cln3− cells. Loss of Cln5 causes defects in adhesion and chemotaxis, which intriguingly, has also been reported for Dictyostelium cells lacking Cln3. Finally, autofluorescence was detected in cln5− cells, which is consistent with observations in mammalian systems. Together, our data support a function for Cln5 during the early stages of multicellular development, provide further evidence for the molecular networking of NCL proteins, and provide insight into the mechanisms that may underlie CLN5 function in humans.

Abstract: The quinazoline based drug prazosin (PRZ) is a potent inducer of apoptosis in human cancer cells. We recently reported that PRZ enters cells via endocytosis and induces tubulation of the endolysosomal system. In a proteomics approach aimed at identifying potential membrane proteins with binding affinity to quinazolines, we detected the oncoprotein CD98hc. We confirmed shuttling of CD98hc towards lysosomes and upregulation of CD98hc expression in PRZ treated cells. Gene knockout (KO) experiments revealed that endocytosis of PRZ still occurs in the absence of CD98hc - suggesting that PRZ does not enter the cell via CD98hc but misroutes the protein towards tubular lysosomes. Lysosomal tubulation interfered with completion of cytokinesis and provoked endoreplication. CD98hc KO cells showed reduced endoreplication capacity and lower sensitivity towards PRZ induced apoptosis than wild type cells. Thus, loss of CD98hc does not affect endocytosis of PRZ and lysosomal tubulation, but the ability for endoreplication and survival of cells. Furthermore, we found that glutamine, lysomototropic agents – namely chloroquine and NH4Cl – as well as inhibition of v-ATPase, interfere with the intracellular transport of CD98hc. In summary, our study further emphasizes lysosomes as target organelles to inhibit proliferation and to induce cell death in cancer. Most importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that the intracellular trafficking of CD98hc can be modulated by small molecules. Since CD98hc is considered as a potential drug target in several types of human malignancies, our study possesses translational significance suggesting, that old drugs are able to act on a novel target.

Abstract: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) causes nosocomial/antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis, with dramatic incidence/mortality worldwide. C. difficile virulence factors are toxin A and toxin B (TcdB) which cause cytopathic/cytotoxic effects and inflammation. Until now studies were focused on molecular effects of C. difficile toxins (Tcds) on different cells while unexplored aspect is the status/fate of cells that survived their cytotoxicity. Recently we demonstrated that enteric glial cells (EGCs) are susceptible to TcdB cytotoxicity, but several EGCs survived and were irreversibly cell-cycle arrested and metabolically active, suggesting that EGCs could became senescent. This is important because allowed us to evaluate the not explored status/fate of cells surviving Tcds cytotoxicity, and particularly if TcdB induces senescence in EGCs. Rat-transformed EGCs were treated with 10 ng/ml TcdB for 6 h–48 h, or for 48 h, followed by incubation for additional 4 or 11 days in absence of TcdB (6 or 13 total days). Senescence markers/effectors were examined by specific assays. TcdB induces senescence in EGCs, as demonstrated by the senescence markers: irreversible cell-cycle arrest, senescence-associated-β‑galactosidase positivity, flat morphology, early and persistent DNA damage (ATM and H2AX phosphorylation), p27 overexpression, pRB hypophosphorylation, c‑Myc, cyclin B1, cdc2 and phosphorylated-cdc2 downregulation, Sirtuin‑2 and Sirtuin‑3 overexpression. TcdB-induced EGC senescence is dependent by JNK and AKT activation but independent by ROS, p16 and p53/p21 pathways. In conclusion, TcdB induces senescence in EGCs. The extrapolation of these results to CDI leads to hypothesize that EGCs that survived TcdB, once they have acquired a senescence state, could cause irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and tumors due to persistent inflammation, transfer of senescence status and stimulation of pre-neoplastic cells.

Abstract: An easy method of preparing well-crystallized Sb2Se3 films and nanorods through magnetron sputtering was proposed, and their growth mechanism was examined. The microstructure, morphology, composition, and optical and electrical properties of the Sb2Se3 films depended strongly on the substrate temperature (Tsub). Sb2Se3 films prepared at > 250°C contained the orthorhombic phase without Sb2O3 phase owing to the high-purity vacuum environment. Well-crystallized Sb2Se3 films deposited at Tsub = 325°C showed compact grains with a bandgap of 1.23eV and a high absorption coefficient of 105cm−1 in the visible region. Photoelectrochemical measurements showed that Sb2Se3 films were p-type semiconductors with excellent photoresponse. A clear photovoltaic effect with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.35% was measured for the first time by using the sputtering Sb2Se3 films as absorbers in a photovoltaic solar cell. At Tsub = 375°C, highly uniform films with monodispersed Sb2Se3 nanorods were obtained. The preferential orientation of the Sb2Se3 crystals by self-organization was promoted by increasing Tsub. By using the Sb2Se3 nanorods as absorbers in a solar cell, good photoresponse and a PCE of 2.15% were achieved.

Abstract: A novel composite CdSe quantum dots (QDs)-polymer film achieving tri-function of electrochromic, electrofluorescent and light-induced coloration effects was deposited. Combining the advantages of both CdSe QDs and conjugated electrochromic polymers, the composite film presents excellent electrochromic properties with low redox potential, high optical contrast and fast response time. In addition, it achieves enhanced performance that the composite film could switch between non-fluorescent and fluorescent state, in which the photoluminescence (PL) intensity is more than twice that of pristine polymer film. Furthermore, the material can gradually become self-colored from bleached state under the irradiation of sunlight. Therefore, the trifunctional composite film may pave a new way for designing energy-saving electrochromic and electrofluorescent device in the future.

Abstract: In order to investigate the mechanism of the photochromic effect in yttrium oxy-hydride (YOxHy) thin films, Doppler broadening positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) was applied to probe the electronic structure and the presence of vacancies in YOxHy and related materials as a function of composition, UV illumination and thermal annealing. The Doppler S and W parameter depth profiles of a series of Y, yttrium di-hydride YH1.9+δ and Y2O3 thin films show strong systematic changes caused by the distinct differences in electronic structure of the metals Y, YH1.9+δ and the wide band gap insulator Y2O3. The Doppler broadening parameters of photochromic YOxHy (a semiconductor with a band gap of ~2.6eV) are intermediate to those of YH1.9+δ and Y2O3. In order to probe the nanostructural changes related to the photochromic effect, the S parameter of YOxHy was monitored during in-situ UV illumination. A small but systematic increase of the S parameter was observed, possibly induced by generation of cation mono-vacancies or small vacancy clusters involving generated anion vacancies. The changes did not relax during bleaching under dark conditions, showing that the structural changes are not directly responsible for the photochromic mechanism. For temperatures above around 90°C, thermal annealing leads to a substantial increase in the Doppler S parameter, pointing to the formation of vacancies by local removal of hydrogen. Simultaneously, the optical band gap increases, consistent with an increase in O:H ratios.

Abstract: The N-terminal signal sequence (SS) on proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is surprisingly diverse in hydrophobicity, in the number of preceding N-terminal residues (N-length), and in charged residues flanking the sequence. However, it remains unclear how these sequences despite their heterogeneity bind to the same site and open the Sec61 translocon. We assessed varying features of SSs and their efficiencies in initiating translocation across the ER by using 5-min radiolabeling in yeast. We found that while hydrophobic SSs with a short N-length efficiently initiated translocation in Sec62 mutant, Sec63 mutant and Sec72 deletion strains, most SSs showed varying degrees of translocation defect in these strains. In particular, Sec71 was required for internal hydrophobic SSs to efficiently initiate translocation. These results suggest that different combinations of Sec62, Sec63, Sec71 and Sec72 dynamically associate with the Sec61 translocon for the optimal binding of incoming SSs of broad characteristics and the initiation of protein translocation in vivo.

Abstract: Currently, an important concern in CPV is inhomogeneity of the light distribution on the cell introduced by the applied optical systems, which may affect system performance. In BICPV applications, the inhomogeneities can be much more severe because of design constraints introduced by the building incorporation. Additionally, one of the predominant loss mechanisms in CPV solar cells is perimeter recombination. In this study, the electrical parameters of CPV cells are investigated under inhomogeneous illumination intensity profiles. Partial shading is used as a model for extremely inhomogeneous illumination, while several shadow patterns are used to study the effect of perimeter recombination on the cell performance. As the latter occurs most strongly in GaAs subcells, shallow and deep junction GaAs CPV cells have been developed and subjected to these experiments, as well as commercial triple junction CPV cells. Deep junction GaAs cells are shown to perform significantly better under concentrated light than their shallow junction counterparts. A large degree of shading exceeding 70% has been found to cause only minor losses in the cell performance of 4%. Also, the cell performance is found to be independent of the location of illumination, in spite of perimeter recombination effects, because the current density spreads out. Clearly, increased illumination inhomogeneities caused by elaborate BICPV optical systems, do not inhibit the electrical performance strongly. As a consequence, a large degree of design freedom exists for the optical systems, which offers good opportunities to develop BICPV that meet all the design challenges of the built environment.

Abstract: Ion channels are pore-forming protein complexes in membranes that play essential roles in a diverse array of biological activities. Ion channel activity is strictly regulated at multiple levels and by numerous cellular events to selectively activate downstream effectors involved in specific biological activities. For example, ions, binding proteins, nucleotides, phosphorylation, the redox state, channel subunit composition have all been shown to regulate channel activity and subsequently allow channels to participate in distinct cellular events. While these forms of modulation are well documented and have been extensively reviewed, in this article, we will first review and summarize channel proteolysis as a novel and quite widespread mechanism for altering channel activity. We will then highlight the recent findings demonstrating that proteolysis profoundly alters Inositol 1,4,5 trisphosphate receptor activity, and then discuss its potential functional ramifications in various developmental and pathological conditions.

Abstract: Silicon heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell that combines traditional pure H2 plasma treatments has been frequently reported in the literature. However, this method requires an individual gas blending step between a-Si:H film deposition and post H2 plasma treatment to stabilize the gas environment in the PECVD chamber. Here, we report the introduction of residual SiH4 molecules in H2 plasma to treat SHJ solar cell devices. In contrast to the traditional H2 plasma treatments, it requires no time interval between the a-Si:H film deposition and H2 plasma treatment, i.e., we merely closed the SiH4 inlet after the a-Si:H deposition. In the meantime, all other PECVD parameters were kept unchanged. Taking advantage of the decreasing SiH4 density during the H2 plasma process, a dense silicon layer was grown onto the top layer of the as-deposited a-Si:H film, which inhibited free H atoms effusing out of the low-mass-density a-Si:H network. The better a-Si:H/c-Si interface passivation results in improvements to both the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the SHJ solar cell in comparison to the counterpart cell treated by the traditional pure H2 plasma. For instance, when the n+ a-Si:H window layer is as thin as ~ 1.8nm, the power-conversion efficiency skyrockets from 2.35% treated by the traditional pure H2 plasma to 16.09% treated by the H2 plasma containing residual SiH4 molecules. For a thicker n+ a-Si:H window layer of ~ 4.3nm, the efficiency is also enhanced from 20.66% to 22.74%. This finding paves the way for a more efficient H2 plasma treatment in pursuit of an outstanding SHJ solar cell.

Abstract: Compact linear Fresnel reflector (CLFR) system employing multiple receivers is promising with better optical performance and cost effectiveness compared to linear Fresnel reflector (LFR) system, especially for applications with limited ground availabilities. Nevertheless, only few researches have been conducted to evaluate optical design and performance of the CLFR system. In this study, geometrical models for the CLFR system with flat mirrors and receivers are developed on the basis of polar orientation. A comparative study of concentration characteristics among the LFR, CLFR-complete and CLFR-hybrid systems is conducted based on numerical, ray tracing simulation and experimental results. In addition, optical design analyses of the CLFR-hybrid system are carried out from various design aspects. It is noteworthy that the mirror arrangement and focal length should be optimized for the CLFR-hybrid system with considerations of the associated geometrical characteristic and optical performance. For a small-scale CLFR-hybrid system with a solar field width of 2100mm and a focal length of 1500mm, the geometrical concentration ratio of 15.14 and ground utilization ratio of 0.95 are achieved respectively. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of the CLFR-hybrid system with flat mirrors and polar orientation, which provide progress to the concentrated solar power technology.

Abstract: Autophagy dysregulation has emerged in age-related neurological diseases (Ulland et al.; Matheoud et al.; Ashkenazi et al.). Alzheimer Disease (AD), the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques caused by aberrant Aβ metabolism (Qiang et al.; Sevigny et al.; Ittner et al.). Glia constitute the brain immune system and ingest extracellular Aβ for degradation via the autophagy-lysosome machinery (Ries and Sastre; Cho et al.). Here, we model the molecular rationale for this clearance process in glioma cells by showing that miR34a inhibits autophagy-mediated disposal of Aβ fibrils and identifying two novel direct targets of miR34a, endophilin-3 and cathepsin B (CTSB, a previously reported enzyme for Aβ degrading (Sun et al.)). Bioinformatics analyses revealed that endophilin-3 expresses at a significantly lower level in neurodegenerative diseases. Its gain-of-function substantially promotes both uptake and degradation of Aβ while small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated endophilin-3 knockdown slowed down Aβ clearance and blocked autolysosome formation. Mechanistically, gene ontology (GO) analysis of the endophilin-3 interactome identified by mass spectrometry uncovered enriched components involved in actin binding (with the highest score). Importantly, we validated that the actin-binding protein phostensin interacted with endophilin-3. Phostensin knockdown restored endophilin-3-mediated up-regulation of Aβ clearance. Thus, our findings indicate that miR34a inhibits Aβ clearance by targeting endophilin-3 and CTSB at multiple steps including uptake and autophagy-mediated degradation.

Abstract: Organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs) are one of the most promising applications of organic semiconductors due to their compatibility with flexible plastic substrates resulting in lightweight, inexpensive, ergonomic and aesthetic products. While the electrical failure mechanisms in OPVs have been thoroughly investigated, little is known about their mechanical stability, which is as important and critical to ensure long term reliability. The characteristic thin films stresses of each layer present in organic solar cells, in combination with other possible fabrication, handling and operational stresses, provide the mechanical driving force for delamination of weak interfaces or even their decohesion, leading to a loss of device integrity and performance. In this study, we developed a technique to probe weak layers or interfaces in inverted polymer:PC60BM solar cells, establishing a new set-up for the so-called probe tack making it similar to a pull-off test. With this in hand, the adhesion of a variety of active layers towards a standard water-based poly(ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) formulation was compared against that of a new organic-solvent based PEDOT:PSS. The organic-solvent based PEDOT:PSS formulation showed improved adhesion compared to the standard water-based formulation. Chemical characterization of the exposed surfaces indicated a difference in their composition, suggesting a stronger interaction of the organic-solvent based PEDOT:PSS with the active layer and resulting in a different fracture path. Indeed, all OPVs with water-based PEDOT:PSS showed a delamination localized at the active layer/PEDOT:PSS interface, while those with the organic-solvent formulation were not fractured at this interface but rather, in the active layer.

Abstract: Photochromic oxygen-containing yttrium hydride has been synthesized using a two step process. The process consists of an initial sputter deposition of oxygen-free yttrium hydride YHx, followed by a controlled reaction with air that causes incorporation of oxygen into the material. An in-situ study of the YHx as it reacted with oxygen was made possible by applying an aluminium capping layer with a low but non-zero oxygen permeability prior to air exposure. During the reaction, the visual appearance of the YHx went from dark and opaque to transparent and yellowish. This transition was accredited incorporation of oxygen into the material, as shown through analysis with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). Grazing incidence x-ray diffraction (GIXRD) studies revealed an fcc structure both before and after oxygen exposure, with a lattice parameter that increased from 5.2 to 5.4Å during the reaction. With the lattice parameter in the oxygen free YHx being equal to that reported earlier for YH2, our findings suggest that the non-reacted YHx in this study is in-fact YH2.

Abstract: A novel 1,8-naphthalimide-based small molecular acceptor (NI-T-C8) was designed and synthesized. The LUMO level of NI-T-C8 was high-lying, which would reduce the energy loss of WBG polymer PCDTBT-C12 based devices. When non-fullerene devices based on PCDTBT-C12: NI-T-C8 were spin-coated from substrates with a temperature of 30°C, the aggregation of NI-T-C8 would lead to an unoptimized film morphology and result in a low power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.68%. After elevating the substrates from 30 to 45°C, the domain size of blend films was decreased and a PCE of 3.61% with a high open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.28V was acquired, but the aggregation of NI-T-C8 for blend films fabricated in 45°C based substrates was still influence the exciton dissociation in the active layers, lower Jsc values for NI-T-C8 based devices in comparison to PC71BM based ones were therefore acquired. This is the first single junction organic solar cell with a PCE higher than 3% could achieve a Voc higher than 1.2V. Our results also demonstrated that elevating the temperature of substrates could reduce the domain size of non-fullerene acceptors, which could provide a strategy to adjust the film morphology of active layer comprising easy-aggregating non-fullerene acceptor.

Abstract: The plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1)11PVT1: plasmacytoma variant translocation 1. gene is a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)22lncRNA: long non-coding RNA. that has been shown to be an oncogene in many cancers. Herein, the function and potential molecular mechanisms connecting PVT1 and miR-195-5p were elucidated in endometrial cancer cell lines. Quantitative real-time PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)33FISH: fluorescence in situ hybridization. demonstrated that PVT1 is up-regulated concomitant with miR-195-5p down-regulation in human endometrial carcinoma tissues. PVT1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while facilitating apoptosis of endometrial cancer cells. Moreover, restoration of miR-195-5p due to PVT1 knockdown exerted tumor-suppressive functions. We observed that PVT1 promotes malignant cell behavior by decreasing miR-195-5p expression. Binding of PVT1 and miR-195-5p was confirmed using luciferase assays. Furthermore, expression of miR-195-5p negatively correlates with PVT1 expression. At the molecular level, either PVT1 knockdown or miR-195-5p overexpression resulted in a decrease of acidic fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR1)44FGFR1: acidic fibroblast growth factor receptor. and basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2).55FGF2: basic fibroblast growth factor. FGFR1 and FGF2 are targets of miR-195-5p that play a critical role in endometrial carcinoma by activating PI3K/AKT and MAPK/Erk pathways. Remarkably, PVT1 knockdown combined with miR-195-5p overexpression led to tumor regression in vivo. Overall, these results depict a novel pathway mediated by PVT1 in endometrial carcinoma, which may have potential application for endometrial carcinoma therapy.

Abstract: Regulation of intracellular calcium (Ca2+) is critical in all cell types. The ryanodine receptor (RyR), an intracellular Ca2+ release channel located on the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum (SR/ER), releases Ca2+ from intracellular stores to activate critical functions including muscle contraction and neurotransmitter release. Dysfunctional RyR-mediated Ca2+ handling has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inherited and non-inherited conditions including heart failure, cardiac arrhythmias, skeletal myopathies, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.

Abstract: In the pursuit of energy efficient materials, vanadium dioxide (VO2) based smart coatings have gained much attention in recent years. In this paper, we investigate Al-doped VO2 films as thermochromic coatings on glass substrates by DC magnetron sputtering. It is found that adding Al3+ ions into VO2 films can generate groups of polygonal grains and nanowire clusters, apart from routinely reducing the valence and decreasing the grain size, through XRD, XPS, Raman shift and SEM results. For optical properties of Al doped films, a blue-shift of absorption edge in transmittance spectra has been introduced, which can significantly improve the luminous transmittance. Further, largely reducing phase transition temperature and enhancing solar modulation ability are also achieved. After carefully analyzing the relationship between the film characterizations and optical performance, we attribute the advanced theromochromic properties to the generation of nanowire clusters by the depositing conditions and the transformation effect of Al dopants. Such good thermochromic performances obtained by Al doping obviously overcome the drawbacks of undoped VO2 films for practical application. This work provides a considerable and new method of optimizing thermochromic properties of VO2 films as smart window coatings.

Abstract: The Cerebral Dopamine Neurotrophic Factor (CDNF) is a neurotrophic factor that has a protective effect in cell and animal models of several neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular mechanism of the protective effect of CDNF is unclear. Many neurodegenerative diseases have been related to a proteostasis dysregulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). A failure of proteostasis produces ER stress, triggering the unfolded protein response (UPR) and, in the long-term, induces cell death. An adaptive UPR solves ER stress by attenuating protein synthesis, inducing chaperones expression, and degradation of misfolded proteins. Since CDNF is an ER resident protein, we investigated whether the role of CDNF is to regulate ER proteostasis. To this end, we determined the effect of CDNF in thapsigargin-induced ER stress in HEK293-T cells and cultured hippocampal neurons. Our results show that CDNF improved the viability of HEK293-T cells exposed to thapsigargin. CDNF increased levels of protective proteins of the early UPR, such as BiP, ATF4, ATF6, and XBP-1 in both HEK293-T cells and neurons. Conversely, expression of CDNF attenuated ER stress-induced apoptotic proteins, CHOP and cleaved caspase-3 in HEK293-T cells and neurons. A mutant CDNF lacking the ER retention sequence failed to protect against ER stress. In conclusion, CDNF regulates proteostasis in the ER by inducing the adaptive UPR response and inhibiting apoptotic pathways triggered by ER stress. We propose that neuroprotection induced by CDNF is mediated by regulating ER proteostasis.

Abstract: Lysosomes are a major organelle for degrading macromolecules. When deprived of nutrients, cells activate the autophagy and lysosome biogenesis pathways to recycle cytoplasmic materials and to increase lysosomal degradation capacity for survival, respectively. We have identified a condition in which cells accumulated enlarged lysosomes upon starvation and lysosome inhibition. Selective autophagy and inhibition of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) in combination with lysosome inhibition were not able to induce this phenomenon. Conversely, knocking out autophagy genes, ATG5 or ATG7, had no effects on the enlarged lysosome formation. This suggests that the enlarged lysosome formation is an autophagy independent process. Remarkably, adding glutamine to the treatment can prevent formation of the enlarged lysosomes and dissipate the pre-existing ones. Furthermore, the nucleus/cytoplasm translocation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), but not mTOR activity, correlates with the formation/dissipation of enlarged lysosomes. Knockdown of TFEB, however, suggests that TFEB-mediated lysosome biogenesis is not directly involved in the process. These results indicate that there is a novel mechanism by which lysosome homeostasis can be regulated under certain stress conditions.

Abstract: Apoptosis and autophagy mutually regulate various cellular physiological and pathological processes. The crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis is multifaceted and complicated. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of their crosstalk will advance the therapeutic applications of autophagy for treating cancer and other diseases. NOXA, a BH3-only member of the BCL-2 family, was reported to induce apoptosis and promote autophagy. Here, we report that autophagy regulates apoptosis by targeting NOXA for degradation. Inhibiting autophagy increases NOXA protein levels by extending the protein half-life. NOXA accumulation effectively suppresses tumor cell growth by inducing apoptosis, which is further enhanced when p53 is present. Mechanistically, NOXA is hijacked by p62 as autophagic cargo, and its three lysine residues at the C-terminus are necessary for NOXA degradation in lysosomes. Taken together, our study demonstrates that NOXA serves as a bridge in the crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis and implies that autophagy inhibitors could be an effective therapy for cancer, especially wild-type p53-containing cancer.

Abstract: The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily signaling pathway contains two general branches, known as TGF-β and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP), that regulate development in animals. It is well known that TGF-β superfamily signaling participates in the regulation of dauer (lifespan extension) in Caenorhabditis elegans, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms of lifespan extension in the pathway. Diapause, a programmed developmental arrest in insects, is similar to dauer in C. elegans. In this study, we find that TGF-β superfamily signaling regulates Helicoverpa armigera diapause via a novel mechanism. Both TGF-β and BMP signals are weaker in the brains of diapause-destined pupae than in nondiapause-destined pupae, and the levels of p-Smad1, POU, TFAM, and mitochondrial activity are decreased in diapause pupae. Development in nondiapause pupae is delayed by an injection of TGF-β or BMP receptor inhibitors. Both TGF-β and BMP signals can activate a common target, Smad1. ChIP and EMSA assays indicate that Smad1 can bind to the POU promoter to regulate its expression. POU can improve the transcription of TFAM, which regulates mitochondrial activity. This is the first report showing that both TGF-β and BMP signals regulate development or diapause through the Smad1-POU-TFAM-mitochondrial activity in insects.

Abstract: Metabolites of sphingomyelin, as well as calcium ion fluxes, have a profound role in cellular signaling in almost all cell types. In addition, metabolites of sphingomyelin often modulate calcium signaling, either directly or indirectly. This is an interesting aspect on how lipids may wield their physiological role, as calcium is probably one of the most versatile signaling molecules in the cell, and as modulation of calcium signaling has profound effects on cellular physiology. The aim of this review is to discuss the mechanisms by which metabolites of sphingomyelin, especially the sphingolipids sphingosine and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), modulate calcium fluxes, and how this may affect cellular function. In addition, the pathological aspects of sphingolipid-evoked modulation of calcium fluxes will be discussed.
